The  lights Cast the  shadows, And that's  I'll be found, For what's  by the morning Will be  by daylight's hounds.  Oh, the Dawn  sweeps all the  clean Of what has  in the night, Hang the  and the crooks High on  hooks As they run from the sun in fright.  Oh the  shadows are  and scattered Where  and  are slain, Only the  you're in can  in sin, So  your  and pains.  The  lights Cast the  shadows, And that's  I'll be found, For what's  by the morning Will be  by daylight's hounds.  Well the  shivers as  is risen, Cold ash  over the sun, For the son to rise  he must go  hell To see what the  has done.  The  are tamed,  in pleasure's chains; Willingly surrendering, There's a song to your soul  you bow to gold, The song the  sing.  The  lights Cast the  shadows, And that's  I'll be found, For what's  by the morning Will be  by daylight's hounds.  [x3] The  lights Cast the  shadows, And that's  I'll be found, For what's  by the morning Will be  by daylight's hounds.
