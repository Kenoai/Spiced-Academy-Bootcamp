Mortal once again Making out,  me pretend And you  words forbidden To see if I've been listening Well now I'm listening  We won't both get our way If we do, it won't be  anyway So I hold you by the jaw And kiss you to be sure With so much more than before  It took a wild  to tame mine And it took a wild  to charm Now a wild  has gone and  me With this ever  glance But this ever  glance  I wouldn't have you any  way Who  love that  sense anyway?  I  I  for the truth I  I  for it,  and unchained But  it  improvised Whatever has you so inspired While I know you're inspired  And no one is  armed To tear me down with a  of the tongue And I  do the same And see how long you can keep face Let's see who  face  But it took a wild  to tame mine And it took a wild  to charm Now a wild  has gone and  me With this ever  glance But this ever  glance  I wouldn't have it any  way Who  love that  sense anyway? I wouldn't have you any  way I don't want what  sense anyway  But it took a wild  to tame mine And it took a wild  to charm Now a wild  has gone and  me With this ever  glance With her ever  glance
