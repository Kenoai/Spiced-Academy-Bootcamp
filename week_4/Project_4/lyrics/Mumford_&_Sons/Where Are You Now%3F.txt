It came to the end it  you had heard. As we  the city streets, You  said a word.  When we  sat down Your eyes were full of spite. I was desperate, I was weak I  not put up a fight.  But  are you now? Where are you now? Do you ever  of me In the quiet, in the crowd?  You were  less in pain Than you were cold. Triumphant in your mind Of the  that you hold.  You said no one  ever know The love that we had shared. As I took my  to go It was  you didn’t care.  And  are you now? Where are you now? Do you ever  of me In the quiet, in the crowd?  But  are you now? Where are you now? Do you ever  of me In the quiet, in the crowd?  And I hear of your coming And your  in the town. I hear  of your smile, I hear  of your frown.  And the  can descend, We can  all the pain. But I know that’s what you love, 'Cause you know I love the same.  But  are you now? Where are you now? Do you ever  of me In the quiet, in the crowd?  But  are you now? Where are you now? Do you ever  of me In the quiet, in the crowd?  But  are you now? Where are you now? Do you ever  of me In the quiet, in the crowd?
