Serve God love me and mend This is not the end Live  we are friends And I'm sorry I'm sorry  Sigh no more, no more One foot in sea one on shore My  was  pure You know me You know me  And man is a  thing Oh man is a  thing Oh man is a  thing Oh man is a  thing  Love that will not  you,  or  you, It will set you free Be more like the man you were made to be There is a design, An  to cry, Of my  to see, The  of love as it was made to be  Love that will not  you,  or  you, It will set you free Be more like the man you were made to be There is a design, An  to cry, Of my  to see, The  of love as it was made to be  Love that will not  you,  or  you, It will set you free Be more like the man you were made to be There is a design, An  to cry, Of my  to see, The  of love as it was made to be
