Broad-shouldered  fill the sky Manhattan  at the night But you are  up in wire Curled up in fright  So I took you to the city for the night To  under  silver lights But for a moment, you were wild With  like a child, just a moment  But wasn't it you who said I was not free And wasn't it you who said I  peace And now it's you who's  by fear of it all  And it's alright Take it out on me And it's alright Take it out on me  These  walls are  thin And no one is  to  in What to hear our doubts Hear our  shouts, they don't care  Wasn't it you who said I was not free Wasn't it you who said I  peace And now it's you who's  by fear of it all  And it's alright Take it out on me And it's alright Take it out on me  But when you feel the  wrapping 'round your neck Feel my hand 'round yours And when you feel the  wrapping 'round your neck Don't succumb  But it's alright Take it out on me  And it's alright Take it out on me And it's alright Take it out on me
