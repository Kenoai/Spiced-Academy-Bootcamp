Perhaps I'll be a bird one day  if I am good enough and I'll  out and fly way  and give up all this stuff  I am from a  land where  only grows and  I'd love to  some day I'd dare not ever go  And  you see my sister she is  and gold They will not hear a word you say they don't  in souls  Perhaps I'll be a bird one day  if I am good enough and I'll get up and fly way  and give up all this stuff  I am from a  land where  only grows and  I'd  to  some day I'd dare not ever go  And  you see my sister They are  and gold They will not hear a word you say they don't  in souls  I am no deceiver I am a believer I am no deceiver
