The  man  on the edge of his porch The days were  and the  was gone There was no one in the town and no one in the field This  barren land had  all it  yield  I've been  off my land at the age of sixteen And I have no idea  else my  could have been I  all my  at the foot of this hill And now I am sure my  can  be still So  your  and  your horse And pray you  feel this same kind of remorse  Seal my  and  my pride I've  to  and now  to hide Align my heart, my body, my mind To face what I've done and do my time  Well you are my accuser, now look in my face Your  reeks of your  and disgrace So one man has and  has not How can you love what it is you have got When you took it all from the weak  of the poor? Liars and  you know not what is in store  There will come a time I will look in your eye You will pray to the God that you  denied Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"  Seal my  and  my pride I've  to  and now  to hide Align my heart, my body, my mind To face what I've done and do my time  Seal my  and  my pride I've  to  and now  to hide Align my heart, my body, my mind To face what I've done and do my time  Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me I know what I've done, 'cause I know what I've seen I went out back and I got my gun I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
