It's in my blood, it's in my water You try to tame me, tame me from the start When the din is in your eye,  your flesh Desperate for a need to rise  With a  crystal on How well you used to know how to shine In the  that's safe from harm I had been  with a  mind  You can be  little  you want  to know And you can try to  out the  below And you can call it love If you want  Beholden now I find  awake Waiting on the edge again You  so  with your mind made up Drinking from your cup of  ends  With a  crystal on How well you used to know how to shine In the  that's safe from harm I had been  with a  mind  You can be  little  you want  to know And you can try to  out the  below And you can call it love If you want  But I  we  in an  love But I  we  in an  love
