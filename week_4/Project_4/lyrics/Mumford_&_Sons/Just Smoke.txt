Tell my  to resign And lift you from my mind I'm not  I'm not  enough To  the  of your love  Just take a  take a breath Lay down your head on my  chest I saw a  then just smoke But as you left I was  your name at the night  Thought we were done Young love  keep us young I  we were done And  love  keep us young  I  we fell to the ground I see you  with no sound Open my  to  some  of peace But the  gives  back to me  So I'll be a  of the flame I lent down to kiss you then  my name And I'll be a  on the wind My  are  from  so  for so long  The  burnt out in our  hands But now I see it's got  to do It's got  to do with  You  we were done Young love  keep us young I  we were done And  love  keep us young  (Why do I keep falling) I  we were done (Why do I keep falling) And  love  keep us young (Why do I keep falling) I  we were done (Why do I keep falling) And  love  keep us young
