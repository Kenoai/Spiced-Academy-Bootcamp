We saw  and death Can't we be still What  you kind From  comes your  mind  Was it  the earth? Tied up in a knot Which I  you were ever there  Do not be afraid Do not be afraid  What’s that I see? I  it's the wild Puts the fear of God in me  And was  a grudge Up from the dust Inconceivable lie  What's that I see? I  it’s the wild Puts the fear of God in me
