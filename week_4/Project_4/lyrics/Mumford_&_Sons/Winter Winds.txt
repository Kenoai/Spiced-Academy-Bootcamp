As the  winds  London with  hearts Oh the  in your eyes  me into your arms Was it love or fear of the cold that led us  the night? For  kiss your  trumped my doubt  And my head told my heart Let love grow But my  told my head This time no This time no  We'll be  and  one day my girl And the time we were  will be left for the world The  that  and  will be  by plague So let the  be good for  who stay  And my head told my heart Let love grow But my  told my head This time no Yes, my  told my head This time no This time no  Oh the  that sent me off from the God that I once loved Was the same that sent me into your arms Oh and  is won when you are lost and I am gone And no hope, no hope will overcome  But if your  strikes at your sleep Remember  swaps snow for leaves You'll be  and  again When the city  and sun ascends  And my head told my heart Let love grow But my  told my head This time no  And my head told my heart Let love grow But my  told my head This time no This time no
