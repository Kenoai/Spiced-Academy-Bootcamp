Oh babe, meet me in  Square Park I  hold you in the dark One last time Just one last time  And oh babe, can you tell what's on my tongue? Can you  that I'll be gone? With the twilight With the twilight  But no  burns forever, oh no You and I both know this all too well And most don't even last the night No they don't, they say they don't  Oh babe, I've  been so lost I  hear you lie One last time Just one last time  But oh babe, I  wish you  not cry I only ever told you one lie When it  have been a thousand It  as well have been a thousand  But no  burns forever, oh no You and I both know this all too well And most don't even last the night No they don't, they say they don't  And we can talk it  again girl Round and round,  and  again Or we  leave it out to die Leave it out just  it out  I  tried to  you babe I just  to work it out But I was  up by doubt If only  were  and white 'Cause I just want to hold you tight Without  back my mind Without  back my mind  But no  burns forever, oh no You and I both know this all too well And most don't even last the night
