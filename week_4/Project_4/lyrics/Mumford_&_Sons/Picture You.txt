If I  tell you "no" I  it best you didn't know Don't see it coming The  visible But when its eyes fix mine The  in its stone I feel it rising, oh The  storm  And when I feel a  is a  away And I don't know how to  it It's a  away And now You don't know me like this It's a  away And I don't know how to hide it It's a  away  And I  you Soaked in light I  you And in you I had no doubt When the  calls me out And it feel it's like  is  I can do I  you  And the  falls fast I know it's  on the skin Will it be ever thus? They're  visible But when your eyes fix mine Embracing you tonight When I hold my breath Through the  and the while  When I feel it rising It's a  away And I don't know how to  it It's a  away And now You don't know me like this It's a  away And I Don't know how to  it It's a  away  And I  you Soaked in light I  you And in you I had no doubt When the  calls me out And it  like it's  I  do I  you
