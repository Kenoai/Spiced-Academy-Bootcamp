I am just a poor boy Though my story's  told I have  my   For a  full of mumbles Such are promises All lies and jests Still a man  what he  to hear And  the rest  When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy In the  of strangers In the  of the  station Running scared Laying low,  out the  quarters Where the  people go Looking for the places Only they  know  Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie  Asking only workman's wages I come  for a job But I get no offers Just a come-on from the  on  Avenue I do  there were  when I was so lonesome I took some  there  Then I'm  out my  clothes And  I was gone  home Where the New York City winters Aren't  me Leading me Going home  La la la la La la la la La la la la  In the  stands a boxer And a  by his trade And he  the reminder Of  glove that laid him down Or cut him till he  out In his  and his shame I am leaving, I am leaving But the  still remains  Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
