Loneliness and all I was  to the spot  a friend Alone again  And I  and I thirst For some shiver For some  words And the  to come  And you saw me low Alone again Didn't they say that only love will win in the end  I didn't fool you but I  you In short, made a fool out of you And a  heart  And I rage and I rage But  I will come of age And be  for you  And you saw me low Alone again Didn't they say that only love will win in the end Didn't they say that only love will win in the end  And you saw me low Alone again Didn't they say that only love will win in the end Didn't they say that only love will win in the end
