And in time As one  the  of past A life  much too fast to hold onto How am I  you?  A  house Another dry  waiting for the rain And I had been  this decay I  you'd do the same  But this is all I ever was And this is all you came  those  ago Now you go too far Don't tell me that I've  because that's not the truth And now I'm  you  Fragile sound The  outside just  as we crawl Crawl  a life of  lines And  time  And so I cry As I hold you for the last time in this life This life I  so hard to give to you What  you have me do?  But this is all I ever was And this is all you came  those  ago Now you go too far Don't tell me that I've  because that's not the truth And now I'm  you  Where I used to end was  you start You were the only one And now I see your eyes move too fast You were the only one  Careful hands And  without that much to say Your  are  as the bed we made Is  another way? Oh love, is  another way?  But this is all I ever was And this is all you came  those  ago Now you go too far Don't tell me that I've  because that's not the truth And now I'm  you  And now I'm  you
