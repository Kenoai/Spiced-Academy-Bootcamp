Oh my With  hair and high rise eyes So  to how the  lies Must do  for your mind  I know I love you now But will I love you then? You can see it in my eyes It doesn't  matter 'Cause man I'm cold Man I'm toothless Man my  is so  useless What a fool you've landed Oh oh oh what a fool you call home  And you I'm  you held my gaze so long With your down-home  and  undone Stand by the man that you call home  I know I love you now But will I love you then? You can see it in my eyes It doesn't  matter 'Cause man I'm cold Man I'm toothless Man my  is so  useless What a fool you've landed Oh oh oh what a fool you call home
