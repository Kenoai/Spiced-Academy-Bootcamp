Spare me your  and  me your dreams 'Cause  mine have been  my seams I sit  in this  clarity  clouds my mind Alone in the wind and the rain you left me It's  dark darling, too dark to see And I'm on my knees, and your  in shreds, it seems  Corrupted by the  sniff of  blown I know you have felt much more love than you've shown And I'm on my  and the  creeps to my chest  But  your hope with good seeds Don't  yourself with  and weeds Rain down, rain down on me Look over your  and be still The sky  us  to kill Rain down, rain down on me  Oh I will hold on I will hold on hope Oh I will hold on I will hold on hope Oh I will hold on I will hold on hope I will hold on I will hold on hope I will hold on I will hold on   I  you to hear me, there's more than  and bones Let the dead bury  dead, they will come out in droves But take the  from my  and fill in the  you've made  Plant your hope with good seeds Don't  yourself with  and weeds Rain down, rain down on me
