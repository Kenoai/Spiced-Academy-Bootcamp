Roll away your  I will roll away mine Together we can see what we will find Don't  me  at this time For I am  of what I will  inside  You told me that I  find a home Within the  substance of my soul And I have  this void with  unreal And all the  my  it steals  And  is a  term don't you think And yet it  the  I see  It  that all my  have been burned But you say 'That's  how this  thing works' It's not the long walk home that will  this heart But the  I  with  start  Darkness is a  term don't you think And yet it  the  I see Darkness is a  term don't you think And yet it  the  I see  Stars hide your fires For  here are my desires And I won't give them up to you this time around And so I'll be found With my  stuck in this ground Marking the  of this  impassioned soul  Stars hide your fires For  here are my desires And I won't give them up to you this time around And so I'll be found With my  stuck in this ground Marking the  of this  impassioned soul  And you, you've gone too far this time You have  reason nor rhyme With  to take this soul that is so  mine
