In the  of the night, I may  you go There'll be no  in the  of  that I have grown There'll be no  in the  of the  thrown But I'd be  if you'd be mine  Stretch out my life and pick the  out Take what you like, but  my ears and eyes Watch me  over and over  I have done wrong, you  your tower But call me home and I will  a throne And wash my eyes out  again  But love the one you hold And I'll be your goal To have and to hold A  of the light  Skin too  and eyes like marbles You spin me high, so  me as I glide Before I  homeward, homeward  I know I tried, I was not stable Flawed by pride, I miss my  eyes So hold my  up,  in and  out  So love the one you hold And I'll be your goal To have and to hold A  of the light  And in the  of the night, I may  you go There'll be no  in the  of  that I have grown There'll be no  in the  of the  thrown You may not  the  of the  I'll show But I'd be  if you'd be mine  So love the one you hold And I will be your goal To have and to hold A  of the light  So love the one you hold And I will be your goal To have and to hold A  of the light
