Sit  in  grandeur But  and shift A  of  silver hair From your eyes I'd  seen you  before As you  "Darling  the door" How have I not made a note of  word You ever said And time, is not on our side But I'll  that it's alright She says the Lord has a plan But  it's  hard to understand  Before you leave You must know you are beloved And  you leave Remember I was with you  Are you afraid However  you not be In this rosy light This is strange I see a hand come  the mirror Pointing at the light Pointing at the  we  see As you put your  arms over me  Before you leave You must know you are beloved And  you Leave  I was with you And as you leave I won't hold you back beloved  We'll sit And talk the  down from the sky And I'll not  the  in your eyes love  And as you leave You must know you are beloved And as you leave I can see the wild has come for you And as you leave I won't hold you back beloved And as you leave See my  playing at your feet
