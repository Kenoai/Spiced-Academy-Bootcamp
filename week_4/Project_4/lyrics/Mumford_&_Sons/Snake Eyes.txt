You hold it, in your hands And let it flow, this cruelty Of  as you fall again Alone, In the  of truth  It's in the eyes I can tell, you will  be danger We had it tonight, why do you  it open?  And the  remain too high For this  mind And the shake, the  itch That  down my spine To  a love divine Don't  a love divine It's a  tight excuse  It's in the eyes I can tell, you will  be danger We had it tonight, why do we  seek absolution? It's in the eyes I can tell you will  be danger  How does the  around your feet Just slip away? And abandon, that  you in the night With  eyes, the most  kind  It's in the eyes! I can tell, you will  be danger! We had it tonight! Why do we  seek absolution? It's in the eyes! I can tell you will  be danger!
