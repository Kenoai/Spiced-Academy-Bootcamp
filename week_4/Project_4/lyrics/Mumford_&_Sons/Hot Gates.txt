There is no  thing, to stop and sing Waiting for the rain And this  pill, it's all too much On the edge again Don't look away Couldn't help but note the  thing In your  face Why do you  speak when you have no grace In your  face  But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone At  hot  you spit your vitriol Though you  you wouldn't do this anymore And I can't be for you all of the  you want me to But I will love you constantly There's  little else to me And  we cry, we must stay alive  Another  edge, and a  sound And then you went aground Near a  blade, a  out of sight There's  here for you tonight  But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone At  hot  you spit your vitriol Though you  you wouldn't do this anymore And I can't be for you all of the  you want me to But I will love you constantly There's  little else to me And  we cry, we must stay alive  Let my  only run out when my  decides There is no way out of your only life So run on, so run!
