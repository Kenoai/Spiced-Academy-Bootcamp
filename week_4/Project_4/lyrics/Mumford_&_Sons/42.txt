Where do I turn to when there's no  to make? And how do I  when there's so much at stake? I was so sure of it all  But what if I need you in my  hour? And what if it  out  is no other? If this is our last hope We  see a sign, oh We  see a sign  Well I've been  from the  we left Forgiveness  for  but how can I forget When there's a  on it all  But what if I need you in my  hour? And what if it  out  is no other? We had it all If this is our time now We  see a sign, oh We  see a sign  So give us a sign I need some  light Children of darkness, oh
