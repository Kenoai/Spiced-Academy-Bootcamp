Take my eye and my  my heart in your hands in your hands  and  the yacht as it departs leave me on the shore but I will hunt no more  Hold my sin  my head  and take me home instead take me home instead  I will not  of your sin there is a way out for him the  shows that  your  are ocean  The door, my  was floored I knew my weakness, oh hold, my hand can sign me not to darkness  you know, my  was floored I knew my weakness, oh hold, my hand can sign me not to darkness
