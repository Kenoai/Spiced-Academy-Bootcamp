Fold your hair  your ears Roll your  across the floor I know you been here for years But at  we've been here before My mind  peace in the  of your attention But gets  by the night I didn't know what I was thinking But I know we’ll be alright  And I will  you With a love too deep for words Hold you from the  and its curse So long as I have  in my lungs Long as there's a song to be sung I will be  and you will be mine Ever our  entwined My rose of Sharon My rose of Sharon  Come  in like a   I'm left in awe of you Every time I  the door I’m left  more of you I wish I had some  sense of occasion But I'll just  and turn away I hope you know by now I don't know  way  When it's said and done I'm  forever Like I said, I'm done I'm  forever  I will  you With a love too deep for words Hold you from the  and its curse So long as I have  in my lungs Long as there's a song to be sung I will be  and you will be mine Ever our  entwined My rose of Sharon My rose of Sharon  With a love too deep for words I’m  forever With a love too deep for words I’m  forever With a love too deep for words I'm  forever With a love too deep for words I’m  forever
