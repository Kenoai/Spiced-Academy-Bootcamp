You don't  turn away this time Then why don't you take a  line Don't have to be  to be kind You don't have to lose your mind You don't  suffer for your art You don't  vivisect your heart And then if you're  apart You're  trying too hard  In the  light I  you breathless But I won't deny I love you helpless  You don't  say what you don't mean You  want to  a  scene You hide in the  with a lamp And cast the  on a screen You don't  sing what you can say Well that's  a hard game to play You  just say a cliche But  there's a will there's a way  But in the  light I  you breathless But I won't deny I love you helpless  Wona, (?) Wona Wona, (?) Wona Wona, (?) Wona Wona, (?) Wona, (?)  In the  light I  you breathless But I won't deny I love you helpless  And I will be  (wona, (?)) And you will be mine (wona) And I will be  (wona, (?)) And you will be mine (wona, (?))
