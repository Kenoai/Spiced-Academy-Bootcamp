Woman Cupped hand is  ice Tangled up in  white Do you ever  know? Can you ever  know?  Woman Watch her take me by surprise When she lets me call her mine Do you ever  know? Can you ever  know?  And I don't know the  she long I don't hear the  words that call inside When you're gone again  I can't read your mind  I'm  all the time There's  I don't know, I can see it in your eyes As the  descends, it's  slow again I am left in awe of the  I adore, oh  Woman I  had such a sign Burn  into my mind Do you ever  know? Can you ever  know?  You say the sun doesn't  for you I hope you  that's not true, in time When you're gone again Just as long again  I can't read your mind  I'm  all the time There's  I don't know, I can see it in your eyes As the  descends, oh it's  slow again But I am left in awe of the  I adore  I can't read your mind  I'm  all the time There's  I don't know, I can see it in your eyes And as the  descends, it's  slow again But I am left in awe of the  I adore
