One, two, three  We're on the  red The  on my eyes When I  your voice The  caught me by  again  And I know you  that you're alright But fix your eyes on me I  I'm all you have And I  you'll see the dawn again  Well I know I had it all on the line But don't just sit with  hands and  blind 'Cause even when  is no star in sight You'll  be my only  light  Relate to my youth Well I'm  in awe of you Discover some new truth That was  wrapped  you  But don't just slip away In the night Don't just hurl Your  from on high  Well I know I had it all on the line But don't just sit with  hands and  blind 'Cause even when  is no star in sight You'll  be my only  light  If we come back and we're broken Unworthy and ashamed Give us  to  in And you know we'll go your way  'Cause I know I had it all on the line But don't just sit with  hands and  blind 'Cause even when  is no star in sight You'll  be my only  light  And I know I had it all on the line But don't just sit with  hands and  blind 'Cause even when  is no star in sight You'll  be my only  light
