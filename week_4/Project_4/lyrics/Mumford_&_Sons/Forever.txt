I know I've had you troubled And I know I've  your mind But you know that I love you And that our love's not blind I'm sure my  lie with you But I've many more besides And if I can't see them through Our love will  die  So if you  for the time that you're spending And if you  for the love in your heart Think of  and the girl you're returning And the days you  will turn to gold  So love with your eyes Love with your mind Love with your, dare I say forever Do it for yourself Do it for the girl Do it for your, dare I say forever  And I've  pious women Who have lead such  lives Shameless in the dark, so  in the light And you may not be  and I may not be saved But we  live  happily and  unfazed  So if you  for the time that you're spending And if you  for the love in your heart Think of  and the girl you're returning And the days you  will turn to gold  So love with your eyes Love with your mind Love with your, dare I say forever Do it for yourself Do it for the girl Do it for your, dare I say forever  I was  of the Liffey I was  of the Thames And now the east  flows by to the same end Are we too  to not look back and stare?  So love with your eyes Love with your mind Love with your, dare I say forever Do it for yourself Do it for the girl Do it for your, dare I say forever
