But hold on to what you  in the light When the  has  you of all your sight  And now this land Means less and less to me  you  through its trees At  turn The  runs away from me and the halo disappears And the hole when you're not near  So what if I was wrong?  But hold on to what you  in the light When the  has  you of all your sight  So hold on to what you  in the light
