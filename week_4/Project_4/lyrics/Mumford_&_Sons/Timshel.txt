Cold is the water It  your  cold mind Already cold, cold mind And  is at your doorstep And it will  your innocence But it will not  your substance  But you are not  in this And you are not  in this As  we will  and we'll hold your hand Hold your hand  And you are the mother The  of your baby child The one to whom you gave life And you have your choices And  are what make man great His  to the stars  But you are not  in this And you are not  in this As  we will  and we'll hold your hand Hold your hand  But I will tell the night And whisper, "Lose your sight" But I can't move the  for you
