You saw my pain,  out in the rain Broken glass, saw the  run from my veins But you saw no  no  in my heart And you  beside my hope torn apart But the  that we knew will  from you And we'll live a long life So give me hope in the  that I will see the light 'Cause oh that gave me such a fright But I will hold as long as you like Just  me we'll be alright  So lead me back Turn  from that place And  my eyes from my  disgrace 'Cause you know my call We'll  my all Now  come and they will hear me roar So give me hope in the  that I will see the light 'Cause oh that gave me such a fright But I will hold as long as you like Just  me we'll be alright  But hold me  bury my  on the cold And hold me  bury my  on the cold  So give me hope in the  that I will see the light 'Cause oh that gave me such a fright But I will hold on as long as you like Just  me that we'll be alright  But the  that we knew made us  or blue But we'll live a long life  And the  that we knew will  from view And we'll live a long life
