So we were up Throwin' dice in the dark I saw you late, last night, come to harm I saw you  in the devil's arms  The  kept coming Really  I  do Eyes with a fire, unquenched, by peace Curse the beauty,  the queen  So we come To a  of no return Yours is the face, that  my body burn And here is the name that our sons will learn Curse the beauty,  the queen Curse the beauty,  me  So when you're weak When you are on your knees I'll do my best, with the time, that's left Sworn with your spirit, you're  fleshed  So f*ck your dreams And don't you pick at our seams I'll turn into a  for you, If you pay me enough None of this counts, if you do,  up  So we come To a  of no return Yours is the face,  makes my body burn And here is the name, that our sons will learn Curse the beauty,  the queen Curse the beauty,  me
