Do not lie to us Don't hide your eyes from us I will take this  cup I will sit upon your floor Tell your stories, tell all of your pain That's what I came here for And your  come and go as you eat  What have I to find in our love, I am a waste My  are  vessels, if I do  in this place And we can  into the shadows And it's good that we can But walk with me, I  we'll find a way And walk with me, I  we'll find a way  But I miss you at the Delta Where the  run into the sea And I'll miss you at the Delta What's behind, I can  see That beyond, that's  me  When it  like  else matters Will you put your arms  me? When it  like  else matters Will you put your arms  me? And does your love  the others? And does your love just make you feel again? Does my love  the others? Does my love just make me feel good?  When it's all just dust to dust And it's how it will be When it's all just  else That  nothing to me When it's all just dust to dust And how it will be When it's all just  else That  nothing to me  Does my love  the others Or does my love just make me feel good Does my love  the others Or does my love just make me feel good  When it  like  else matters Will you put your arms  me? When it  like  else matters Will you put your arms  me? And does your love  the others? Does my love, just make you feel good?
