Your eyes, they tie me down so hard. I'll  learn to put up a guard. So keep my love, my  bright. Learn me hard oh,  me right.  This ain't no sham. I am what I am.  Though I may speak, some  of old Or even spit out some holy word. I have no  from  to   When you  me down and see I'm weak  We will run and scream. You will  with me. They'll  our dreams And we'll be free And we will be who we are And they'll heal our scars. Sadness will be far away.  So as we walked Through  of green, It was the  sun I'd ever seen. And I was broke, I was on my knees. You said yes as I said please.  This ain't no sham. I am what I am. I'll  no time For a cynic's mind.  We will run and scream. You will  with me. Fulfill our dreams And we'll be free We will be who we are And they'll heal our scars. Sadness will be far away.  Do not let my  flesh go to waste As it  my  and soul in its place. And I will love with urgency But not with haste.
