No more  no more lies Do and deal for no surprises 'Cause you will  slip away Slip away in the night  Waiting  for the sun to rise In  a  smile But you will  slip away Slip away in the night  You find me  here for you Come and  here You find me  my  for you Come and  here  In the  of a mind's eye We had a deal for no surprises 'Cause you will  slip away Slip away in the night  But you're not yourself I know you  than you But you're not yourself I know you  than you  You find me  my  for you It's  more than I can take I wouldn't have it any  way You find me on my  for you It's  more than I can take I wouldn't have it any  way  Don't you lie down Be  in love Don't you  now Be  in love Don't you  now Be still  You find me  my  for you It's  more than I can take I wouldn't have it any  way You find me on my  for you It's  more than I can take I wouldn't have it any  way  But you're not yourself I know you  than you And you're not yourself I know you  than you
