It's  in the  of your heart The sun, it  slowly as you walk Away from all the fears And all the  you've left behind  The  left no food for you to eat You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see But I have seen the same I know the  in your defeat  But I will hold on hope And I won't let you choke On the  around your neck  And I'll find  in pain And I will  my ways I'll know my name as it's  again  ‘Cause I have  things to fill my time You take what is  and I'll take mine Now let me at the truth Which will  my  mind  So tie me to a post and  my ears I can see  and  through my tears I know my call  my faults And  my  fears  But I will hold on hope And I won't let you choke On the  around your neck  And I'll find  in pain And I will  my ways I'll know my name as it's  again  So come out of your cave  on your hands And see the  hanging  down You can  dependence When you know the maker's land  So make your siren's call And sing all you want I will not hear what you have to say  ‘Cause I need  now And I need to know how To live my life as it's  to be  And I will hold on hope And I won't let you choke On the  around your neck  And I'll find  in pain And I will  my ways I'll know my name as it's  again
