Love was kind for a time But now just  and it  me blind This  holds my eyes too bright But I can't see the  other in my life  We too  and  too strong To bear the  of  lovers eyes I feel numb  your tongue Beneath the  of  lovers eyes  But do not ask the  I pay I must live with my  rage Tame the  in my head That run wild and wish me dead Should you  my ash to the wind Lord  all of my sins And let me die  I lie Beneath the  of  lovers eyes  There is no  or drug I've tried To rid the  of  lover's eyes I feel numb  her tongue Her  just  me feel less strong  But do not ask the  I pay I must live with my  rage Tame the  in my head That run wild and wish me dead Should you  my ash to the wind Lord  all of my sins And let me die  I lie Beneath the  of my  eyes  I walk slow I walk slow Take my hand help me on my way, ha
