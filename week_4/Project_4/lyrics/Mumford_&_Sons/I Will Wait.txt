Well I came home Like a stone And I fell  into your arms These days of dust Which we've known Will blow away with this new sun  But I'll  down Wait for now And I'll  down Know my ground  And I will wait, I will wait for you And I will wait, I will wait for you  So  my step And relent You  and I won't forget Know what we've seen And him with less Now in some way Shake the excess  'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you And I will wait, I will wait for you And I will wait, I will wait for you And I will wait, I will wait for you  Now I'll be bold As well as strong And use my head  my heart So take my flesh And fix my eyes A  mind free from the lies  And I'll  down Wait for now I'll  down Know my ground  Raise my hands Paint my  gold And bow my head Keep my  slow  'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you And I will wait, I will wait for you And I will wait, I will wait for you And I will wait, I will wait for you
