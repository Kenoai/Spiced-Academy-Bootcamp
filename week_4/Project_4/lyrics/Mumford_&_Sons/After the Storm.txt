And  the storm, I run and run as the  come And I look up, I look up, On my  and out of luck, I look up.  Night has  pushed up day You must know life to see decay But I won't rot, I won't rot Not this mind and not this heart, I won't rot.  And I took you by the hand And we  tall, And  our own land, What we  for.  But  will come a time, you'll see, with no more tears. And love will not  your heart, but  your fears. Get over your hill and see what you find there, With  in your  and  in your hair.  And now I  to what I knew I saw  what was true But oh no more. That's why I hold, That's why I hold with all I have. That's why I hold.  I won't die  and be left there. Well I  I'll just go home, Oh God  where. Because  is just so full and man so small. Well I'm  of what's  and what's before.  And  will come a time, you'll see, with no more tears. And love will not  your heart, but  your fears. Get over your hill and see what you find there, With  in your  and  in your hair.  And  will come a time, you'll see, with no more tears. And love will not  your heart, but  your fears. Get over your hill and see what you find there, With  in your  and  in your hair.
