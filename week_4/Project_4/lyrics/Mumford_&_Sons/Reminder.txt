Don't let me  your door It's not what I came here for No it's not what I came here for  And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone I won't know if I'm  you wrong I  know if I'm  you wrong  Constant  of  I can find her A  that  give up the way Is all that I'm  for Without her I'm lost Oh my love don't fade away  So  the  tear us apart A  mind and a  heart You  see my  heart  And your  always  on And I've been  oh so long I've been  oh so long  Constant  of  I can find her A  that  give up the way Is all that I'm  for Without her I'm lost Oh my love don't fade away  Oh my love don't fade away
