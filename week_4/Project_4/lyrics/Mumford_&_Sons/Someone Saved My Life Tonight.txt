When I  of  east end lights,  nights The  drawn in the  room downstairs Prima donna, lord, you  should have been there Sitting like a  perched in her  chair And it's one more beer And I don't hear you anymore We've all gone  lately My  out  rolling  the  floor  And  saved my life  sugar bear You  had your  in me, didn't you dear You  had me  and tied Altar-bound, hypnotized Sweet  whispered in my ear You're a butterfly And  are free to fly Fly away, high away, bye bye  I  realized the  hours Of  showers A slip  hanging, in my  dreams I'm  by your  social scene Just a pawn out-played by a  queen It's four o'clock in the morning Damn it!  to me good I'm  with  tonight Saved in time,  god my music's  alive  And  saved my life tonight,  bear You  had your  in me, didn't you dear You  had me  and tied Altar-bound, hypnotized Sweet  whispered in my ear You're a butterfly And  are free to fly Fly away, high away bye bye  And I  have  head on into the deep end the river Clinging to your  and bonds Paying you  forever They're  in the  with a  to take me home Someone  my life tonight,  saved my life tonight Someone  my life tonight,  saved my life tonight So save your  and run the  you play alone  And  saved my life tonight,  bear You  had your  in me, didn't you dear You  had me  and tied Altar-bound, hypnotized Sweet  whispered in my ear You're a butterfly And  are free to fly Fly away, high away, bye bye  Someone saved,  saved,  saved my life tonight
