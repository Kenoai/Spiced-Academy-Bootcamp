Weep for yourself, my man, You'll  be what is in your heart Weep  lion man, You're not as  as you were at the start Rate  and rake yourself, Take all the  you have left Wasted on  all the  that you made in your own head  But it was not your  but mine And it was your  on the line I  fucked it up this time Didn't I, my dear? Didn't I, my dear?  Tremble for yourself, my man, You know that you have seen this all before Tremble  lion man, You'll  settle any of your scores Your  is  in your face, Your  stands  among the wreck Now  from your  or else  your days  your own neck  But it was not your  but mine And it was your  on the line I  fucked it up this time Didn't I, my dear?  But it was not your  but mine And it was your  on the line I  fucked it up this time Didn't I, my dear? Didn't I, my dear?  But it was not your  but mine And it was your  on the line I  fucked it up this time Didn't I, my dear?  But it was not your  but mine And it was your  on the line I  fucked it up this time Didn't I, my dear? Didn't I, my dear?
