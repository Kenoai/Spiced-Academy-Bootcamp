I  be  of this Ripple on  from a  drip A  tree that  me I'm alone,  Him and me.  the life its self can not aspire To have  be so admired I  creation to my kin with the  broken by a  wind.  All of this can be broken All of this can be broken Hold your  by his  and spin him to the ground.  And root to root and tip to tip I look at him my  chip Let it up by all his fears But  brought you  to tears.  Many  and many miles Like you to me on this  isle and one of  you wish to speak Have you come here to  me?  All of this can be broken All of this can be broken Hold your  by his  and spin him to the ground.  But I am keeper And I hold your face away from light I am  till they come I am  till they come.
