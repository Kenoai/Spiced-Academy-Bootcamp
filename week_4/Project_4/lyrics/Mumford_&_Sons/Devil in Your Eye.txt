She was  but light-headed, a daydream Earning from her eyes down to her knees With some kind of love Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate How  they are and  to interchange Some kind of love  I'll be the  in your eye If it's what you need to heal I'll be the  in your eye If it'll  the way you feel  Hold my breath, I know it's me you're  blame Blame my mother,  my mood, it's all the same Some kind of love Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate How  they are and  to interchange Just some kind of love  I'll be the  in your eye If it's what you need to heal I'll be the  in your eye If it'll  the way you feel  'Bout some kind of love, what are you  onto? Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose Some kind of love, what are you  onto? Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose (Some kind of love, what are you  onto?) (Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose) (Some kind of love, what are you  onto?) (Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose) (Some kind of love, what are you  onto?) (Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose) (Some kind of love, what are you  onto?) (Some kind of love)
