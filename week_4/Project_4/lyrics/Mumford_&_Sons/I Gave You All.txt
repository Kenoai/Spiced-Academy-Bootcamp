Rip the  in two with your mind Seal the urge  ensues with  wires I  meant you any harm But your  feel warm as they fall on my forearms  But  my eyes for a while Force from the  a  smile  How can you say that your  is  than ours? Shoulder to shoulder, now brother, we  no arms The  man  in the doorway, his home If only I had an  bigger than my  I  have won  But I gave you all I gave you all I gave you all  Close my eyes for a while Force from the  a  smile  But I gave you all I gave you all I gave you all  And you rip it from my hands And you  it's all gone And you rip out all I had Just to say that you've won  And you rip it from my hands And you  it's all gone And you rip out all I had Just to say that you've won  Well now you've won But I gave you all I gave you all I gave you all
