You were cold as the  through your bones And the  which led us from our  homes Well I was lost  And now I sleep Sleep the  and that I can't weep When all I knew was  in  holes I was lost  Keep the  below my feet For all my sweat, my  runs weak Let me  from  I have been Keep my eyes to  and my  to learn Keep my eyes to  and my  to learn  And I was still I was  your spell When I was told by  all was well So all must be well  Just give me time You know your  and mine So wrap my  in ivy and in twine For I must be well  Keep the  below my feet For all my sweat, my  runs weak Let me  from  I have been Well keep my eyes to serve, my  to learn keep my eyes to serve, my  to learn  Keep the  below my feet For all my sweat, my  runs weak Let me  from  I have been Keep my eyes to serve, my  to learn Keep my eyes to serve, my  to learn
