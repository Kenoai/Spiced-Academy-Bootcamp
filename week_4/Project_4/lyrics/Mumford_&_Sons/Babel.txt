I know the time has  my days, And I'll go  with  you say But I'll ride home laughing, look at me now, For the  of my  they come  down And my ears hear the call of my  sons, And I know the  color all I've done But I'll  it all to the watchman's son, I ain't ever  a year  spent in love  'Cause I know my weakness, know my voice And I'll  in  and choice And I know  my  is fast But I'll be born  a mask  Like the city that  my  and my pride, I  my arms into the sky I cry Babel, Babel, look at me now For the  of my  they come  down You ask  will we  in the  that will howl Is all we see we'll  to the cloud? So come down from your  and  where we've been You know our  is weak and our body thin  Press my nose up to the  around your heart I should've  I was  from the start You'll  your walls, and I will play my  part To tear, tear them down Well I'm  tear, tear them down  'Cause I know my weakness, know my voice And I'll  in  and choice And I know  my  is fast But I'll be born  a mask
