I came here  a choice I'm  I  never  you For  me more trouble I didn't want any trouble If you were  one more chance Would you  me back to life? Bring me back into the light Into the light  And let it  on, let it  on us  And if I say I love you, well, then I love you And if I say I love you, well, then I love you  The  in your face bled out  a trace You've won  an enemy, you're ill  a remedy As  bleeds into night, and I know I came off  than you It doesn't mean that I feel better It doesn't mean that I feel better  And let it  on, let it  on us  And if I say I love you, well, then I love you And if I say I love you, well, then I love you And if I say I love you, well, then I love you And if I say I love you, well, then I love you  Show me your hands Are they  than mine? Show me your face Did you  the line? Show me your eyes They any  than mine? Your soul survives But peace, you'll  find  And if I say I love you, well, then I love you And if I say I love you, well, then I love you And if I say I love you, well, then I love you And if I say I love you, well, then I love you
