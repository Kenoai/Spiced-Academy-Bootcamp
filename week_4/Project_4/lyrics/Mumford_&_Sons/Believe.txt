You may call it in this evening But you've only lost the night Present all your  feelings May they  you tonight And I'm  over something And I'm  through  walls  I don't even know if I believe I don't even know if I believe I don't even know if I believe Everything you're  to say to me  I had the  feeling Your world's not all it seems So  of misconceiving What else this could've been  I don't even know if I believe I don't even know if I believe I don't even know if I believe Everything you're  to say to me  So open up my eyes Tell me I'm alive This is  gonna go our way If I'm  have to  what's on your mind  Say something, say something Something like you love me Less you want to move away From the  of this place  Well I don't even know if I believe I don't even know if I believe I don't even know if I  believe Everything you're  to say to me  So open up my eyes Tell me I'm alive This is  gonna go our way If I'm  have to  what's on your mind  So open up my eyes Tell me I'm alive This is  gonna go our way If I'm  have to  what's on your mind
