Though I may  some  of old Or even spit out some holy word I have no  with  to speak When you sit me down and see I'm weak  We will run and scream You will  with me We'll  our dreams And we'll be free  We will run and scream You will  with me We'll  our dreams And we'll be free  We will be who we are And they'll heal our scars Sadness will be far away  So I had done  but you put me right My  burned in the  of night When I give less than I take It is my fault, my own mistake  We will run and scream You will  with me We'll  our dreams And we'll be free  We will be who we are And they'll heal our scars Sadness will be far away
