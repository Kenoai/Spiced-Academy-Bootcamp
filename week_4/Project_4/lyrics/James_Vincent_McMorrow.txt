From the woods, from the woods They are  from the woods Riding  cloaked in gray Make  way, to my door Lay  boots upon my floor Wash  hands and  to pray But I am gone, I am not there I have  mountain bears To a cave of  tome There I wait, by the mouth As the  it  out Then I'll  drag one home  All  things are ever lost Stillness has  my love to cost  From the woods, from the woods Once a  from the woods At a  between two tracks Bound by tape, and by wire Bruised and  in the fire So the  faded black Newer ropes,  nets Have us  further depths For the  we'll  be Should we go,  we die If the  it was to slide Drag our  to the sea  All  things are ever lost Stillness has  my love to cost  I  the  on my breath I see the  pool on the step The moon so thick, the  so fresh And all is well  From the woods, from the woods, they are coming From the woods (Ah)
