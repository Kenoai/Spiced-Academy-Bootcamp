Throw me a line Anything you want to Drag me along Now I'm  losing Tell me a lie Anything you want to Anything you want to Anything you want  Everyone's so busy now And I find  at the beginning So  of  out I  myself that I was winning  Grab at my throat Until my  is freezing I'm in a canyon So I can't tell the  change When you're alone Do you  believe it? Do you  believe it? Do you  believe?  I hope when it  you feel it I hope when it cuts you bleed And I hope when it  you that We are  together I hope when it  you feel it I hope when it cuts you bleed And I hope when it  you that We are  together  Kick it down Like it can only fall so far We were wrong There is no  to the floor So kick it down There's no  to it There's no  to it There's no  to it  Everyone's so busy now So when you find  at the beginning So  of  out You'll  yourself that you are winning  Everyone's so busy now And the  is when you call if all I hear it So  of  out I'll be on my way in  pieces  I hope when it  you feel it I hope when it cuts you bleed And I hope when it  you that We are  together  I hope when it  you feel it I hope when it cuts you bleed And I hope when it  you that We are  together  I hope when it  you feel it I hope when it cuts you bleed And I hope when it  you that We are  together  I hope when it  you feel it I hope when it cuts you bleed And I hope when it  you that We are  together  We are  together We are  together
