She was  but light-headed, a daydream Earning from her eyes down to her knees With some kind of love Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate How  they are and  to interchange Some kind of love  I'll be the  in your eye If it's what you need to heal I'll be the  in your eye If it'll  the way you feel  Hold my breath, I know it's me you're  blame Blame my mother,  my mood, it's all the same Some kind of love Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate How  they are and  to interchange Just some kind of love  I'll be the  in your eye If it's what you need to heal I'll be the  in your eye If it'll  the way you feel  'Bout some kind of love, what are you  onto? Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose Some kind of love, what are you  onto? Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose (Some kind of love, what are you  onto?) (Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose) (Some kind of love, what are you  onto?) (Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose) (Some kind of love, what are you  onto?) (Some kind of love when you're  you're  lose) (Some kind of love, what are you  onto?) (Some kind of love)
I am just a poor boy Though my story's  told I have  my   For a  full of mumbles Such are promises All lies and jests Still a man  what he  to hear And  the rest  When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy In the  of strangers In the  of the  station Running scared Laying low,  out the  quarters Where the  people go Looking for the places Only they  know  Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie  Asking only workman's wages I come  for a job But I get no offers Just a come-on from the  on  Avenue I do  there were  when I was so lonesome I took some  there  Then I'm  out my  clothes And  I was gone  home Where the New York City winters Aren't  me Leading me Going home  La la la la La la la la La la la la  In the  stands a boxer And a  by his trade And he  the reminder Of  glove that laid him down Or cut him till he  out In his  and his shame I am leaving, I am leaving But the  still remains  Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Where do I turn to when there's no  to make? And how do I  when there's so much at stake? I was so sure of it all  But what if I need you in my  hour? And what if it  out  is no other? If this is our last hope We  see a sign, oh We  see a sign  Well I've been  from the  we left Forgiveness  for  but how can I forget When there's a  on it all  But what if I need you in my  hour? And what if it  out  is no other? We had it all If this is our time now We  see a sign, oh We  see a sign  So give us a sign I need some  light Children of darkness, oh
One, two, three  We're on the  red The  on my eyes When I  your voice The  caught me by  again  And I know you  that you're alright But fix your eyes on me I  I'm all you have And I  you'll see the dawn again  Well I know I had it all on the line But don't just sit with  hands and  blind 'Cause even when  is no star in sight You'll  be my only  light  Relate to my youth Well I'm  in awe of you Discover some new truth That was  wrapped  you  But don't just slip away In the night Don't just hurl Your  from on high  Well I know I had it all on the line But don't just sit with  hands and  blind 'Cause even when  is no star in sight You'll  be my only  light  If we come back and we're broken Unworthy and ashamed Give us  to  in And you know we'll go your way  'Cause I know I had it all on the line But don't just sit with  hands and  blind 'Cause even when  is no star in sight You'll  be my only  light  And I know I had it all on the line But don't just sit with  hands and  blind 'Cause even when  is no star in sight You'll  be my only  light
