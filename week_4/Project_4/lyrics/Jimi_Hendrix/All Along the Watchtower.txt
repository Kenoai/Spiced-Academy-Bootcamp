There must be some kind of way  here Said the  to the thief There's too much confusion I can't get no relief  Business men, they  my wine Plowman dig my earth None were  on the mind Nobody up at his word Hey, hey  No  to get excited The  he  spoke There are many here  us Who feel that life is but a joke But, uh, but you and I, we've been  that And this is not our fate So let us stop talkin'  now The hour's  late, hey  All  the watchtower Princes kept the view While all the  came and went Barefoot servants, too Outside in the cold distance A  did growl Two  were approaching And the wind  to howl
