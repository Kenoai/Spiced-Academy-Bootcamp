Goin' home tomorrow Can't  your evil ways Goin' home tomorrow Can't  your evil ways  When you're  me I'm full of  all day  I can't go on I can't go on this way I can't go on I can't go on this way  You don't want my loving So I'm  away to stay  Don't try to find me Don't ever call me on the phone Don't try to find me Don't ever call me on the phone  I'm  off  you So won't you  poor me alone
