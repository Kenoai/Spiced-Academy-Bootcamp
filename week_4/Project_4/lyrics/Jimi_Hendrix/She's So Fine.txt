She  with a bell-clock  her neck So the  think she's in with time Time... Her hair  like  on a deck Branches  me from her neck  She's so fine She's so very very fine  The sun from a  sinks into her eyes The rain from a tree  into her mind Mind... Morning sign  just like a lock All  signs are  a stock  She's so fine She's so very very fine  When I veer I get so near But so far far far away Listen to me today  We  just  a leaf The  was hard  her her  Ahhhahhh She's so fine Ahhhahhh
