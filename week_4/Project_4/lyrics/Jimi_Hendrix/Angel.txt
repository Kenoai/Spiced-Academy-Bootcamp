Angel came down from  yesterday She  with me just long  to  me And she told me a  yesterday, About the  love  the moon and the deep blue sea And then she  her  high over me She said she's  come back tomorrow  And I said "fly on my  angel, Fly on  the sky, Fly on my  angel, Tomorrow I'm  be by your side"  Sure  this  came on to me Silver  silhouetted  the child's sunrise And my  she said on to "Today is the day for you to rise, Take my hand, you're  be my man, You're  rise" And then she took me high over yonder  And I said "fly on my  angel, Fly on  the sky, Fly on my  angel, Forever I will be by your side"
