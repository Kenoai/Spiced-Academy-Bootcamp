Turn off your mind  and  down stream It is not dying, it is not dying  Lay down all thoughts,  to the void, It is shining, it is shining.  Yet you may see the  of within It is being, it is being  Love is all and love is everyone It is knowing, it is knowing  And  and hate  the dead It is believing, it is believing  But  to the  of your dreams It is not leaving, it is not leaving  So play the game "Existence" to the end Of the beginning, of the beginning
