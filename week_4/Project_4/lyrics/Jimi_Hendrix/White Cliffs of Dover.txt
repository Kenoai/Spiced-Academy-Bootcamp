Tommy:  [Chorus:] I'm free-I'm free, And  tastes of reality, I'm free-I'm free, An' I'm  for you to  me.  If I told you what it takes To  the  high, You'd  and say 'nothing's that simple' But you've been told many  before Messiahs  to the door And no one had the guts to  the temple!  [Chorus:]  [Chorus:]  How can we follow? How can we follow?
