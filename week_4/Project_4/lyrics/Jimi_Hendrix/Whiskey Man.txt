Whiskey man's my friend, he's with me  all the time He  joins me when I drink, and we get on just fine  Nobody has ever seen him, I'm the only one Seemingly I must be mad,  is fun If that's the way it's done  Doctors say he just a  of my  mind If they can't see my  man they must be  blind  Two men  in  collected me two days ago They said there's only room for one and  man can't go  Whiskey man will  away if he's left on his own I can't even ring him 'cause he isn't on the phone Hasn't got a home  Life is very  in my  padded cell It's a  there wasn't room for  man as well  Whiskey man's my friend, he's with me  all the time He  joins me when I drink, and we get on just fine Just fine
