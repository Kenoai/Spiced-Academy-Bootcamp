The Red  in  millions Will  their borders And  then will  in our Rael  Rael, the home of my religion To me the  of the Earth  The Red  in  millions Will  their borders And  then will  in our Rael  My  is threatened My  are torn and cornered And so to do my best I'll  sail And so to do my best I'll  sail  Now Captain,  to my instructions Return to this spot on  Day Look  the  for my signal And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay  If a  flag is fluttering Sickly  against the morn Then you'll know my  has ended And you'll send your boat ashore  But if a red flag is flying Brazen bold  the blue Then you'll know that I am staying And my  belongs to you  Now Captain,  to my instructions Return to this spot on  Day Look  the  for my signal And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay  He's  if he  we're  back again He's  if he  we're  back again He's  if he  we're  back again He's crazy, anyway  If a  flag is fluttering Sickly  against the morn Then you'll know my  has ended And you'll send your boat ashore
