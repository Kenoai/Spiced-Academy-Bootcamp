Ever  I was a  boy, I've  the  ball. From Soho down to Brighton I must have  them all. But I ain't seen  like him In any  hall That deaf dumb and  kid Sure  a mean pin ball!  He  like a statue, Becomes part of the machine. Feeling all the bumpers Always  clean. He  by intuition, The  counters fall. That deaf dumb and  kid Sure  a mean pin ball!  He's a pin ball wizard There has got to be a twist. A pin ball wizard, S'got such a  wrist.  How do you  he does it? I don't know! What  him so good?'  He ain't got no distractions Can't hear  buzzers and bells, Don't see  a flashin' Plays by  of smell. Always has a replay, 'N'  tilts at all That deaf dumb and  kid Sure  a mean pin ball.  I  I was The  table king. But I just handed My pin ball  to him.  Even on my  table He can beat my best. His  lead him in And he just does the rest. He's got  flipper fingers Never seen him fall That deaf dumb and  kind Sure  a mean pin ball!!!
