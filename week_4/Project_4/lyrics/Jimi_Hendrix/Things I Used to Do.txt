The  that I used to do, lord, I won't do no more I said, the  that I used to do, yeah I won't do no more I used to  run and hold your hand babe and cry, oh babe do not go?   I used to  all  for you babe All my  would  end in vain I used to  all  for you  Lord all my  would  end in vain But I knew all the time babe that you was hid out wit' your  man  Gonna  you all lonely, baby Try  else, love one more time Gonna  you home baby Try  else, love one more time The way you  me child, I'm 'bout to lose my mind
