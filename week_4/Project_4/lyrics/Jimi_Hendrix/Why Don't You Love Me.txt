Why don't you love me like you used to do? How come you  me like a worn out shoe? My hair's  curly and my eyes are  blue Why don't you love me like you used to do?  Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' In a long, long while We don't get nearer, further Closer than a  mile  Why don't you  me like you used to do? And say  nothing's like you used to coo I'm the same old  that you've  been through So why don't you love me like you used to do?  Well, why don't you just be like you used to be? How come you find so many  with me? Somebody's  so  a clue Why don't you love me like you used to do?  Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' In a long, long while We don't get nearer, further Closer than a  mile  Why don't you say the  you used to say? What  you  me like a  of clay? My hair's  curly and my eyes are  blue Why don't you love me like you used to do?  Why don't you love me like you used to do? Why don't you love me like you used to do?
