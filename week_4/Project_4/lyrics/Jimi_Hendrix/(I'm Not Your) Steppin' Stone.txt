I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone.  You're  to make your mark in society, You're  all the  that you used on me, You're  all them high-fashion magazines, The  you're wearing, girl, they're  public scenes.  I said, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone. (No!)  Not your steppin' stone, Not your steppin' stone,  When I  met you, girl, you didn't have no shoes, But, now you're  around like you're  page news, You've been  careful 'bout the  you choose, But, you won't find my name in your book of "Who's Who".  I said, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone, (No, girl, not me!) I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone. (No!)  Not your steppin' stone, I'm not your steppin' stone,  Not your steppin' stone, Not your steppin' stone, Not your steppin' stone, Not your steppin' stone,  No, girl, I'm not your steppin' stone, Not your steppin' stone, Not your steppin' stone, Not your steppin' stone,
