Well, I came upon a  of god He was  along the road And I  him, "where are you going?" And this he told me  I'm  on down to Yasgur's Farm I'm  join in a rock and roll band I got to get back to the land And set my soul free  We are stardust We are golden And we've got to get  back to the garden  Though can I walk  you? I have come here to lose the smog And I feel to be a cog in  turning  Now  it is just the time of year Or  it's the time of man And I don't know who I am But life is for learning  We are stardust We are golden And we've got to get  back to the garden  We are stardust We are golden And we've got to get  back to the garden  By the time we got to Woodstock We were half a  strong And  there was song and celebration  And I  I saw the bombers Riding  in the sky Turning into butterflies Above our nation  We are stardust We are golden And we've got to get  back to the garden,   Oh back to the  oh now Gonna back,  back,  back to the garden
