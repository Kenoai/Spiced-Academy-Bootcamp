Oh Mr. pit Oh Mr. pit Mr. pitiful Who let you down? Who let you down? Who let you down?  You  don't believe You don't believe You don't believe That greed's for a show Your soap box unfolds  But,  come down from that cloud You see at all I don't  you to  that you were wrong Just  know how you've been Don't make me feel bad that we're  friends Started it all over in my bed  I hope that you see  your picket I hope that you see  your big yard and  picket fence To make amends, to  be friends, to  be my friend  So  did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go? While I was out While I was out While I was out  Well I don't believe I don't believe I don't believe Everything was seen And if you don't like the  then quit at me  But,  come down from that cloud You see at all I don't  you to  that you were wrong Just  know how you've been Don?t make me feel bad that we're  friends Started it all over in my bed  I hope that you see  your picket I hope that you see  your big yard and  picket fence To make amends,  be friends,  be friends, to  be my friend,  be my friend,  be my friend
