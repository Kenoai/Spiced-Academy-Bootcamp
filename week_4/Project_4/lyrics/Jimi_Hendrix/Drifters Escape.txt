Oh, help me in my weakness I  the  say As they  him from the  room  And were  him away Well, my trip hasn't been a  one And my time it isn't long And I  do not know  What is was that I've done wrong  Well the  he cast his robe aside A tear came to his eye Well you fail to understand, he said Why must you even try Outside the  was stirring You  hear it from the door Inside the  was  down While the jury  for more, more, more Cried for more,  for more  Hey you  leave that boy's soul alone  Oh stop that  the jury Grab me a  and me a nurse Oh, the  was bad enough Yes, but this is ten  worse Just then bolt of lightning Showed the  house out of shape And  everybody  to pray The  made his escape The  did his escape Yeah So long
