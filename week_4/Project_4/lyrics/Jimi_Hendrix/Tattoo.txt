Me and my  were  to each other 'Bout what  a man a man Was it  or brawn, or the  you were born We just couldn't understand  Our old man didn't like our appearance He said that only  wear long hair  So me and my  borrowed  from Mother We knew what we had to do We went downstairs, past the  and gymnasium And got our arms tattooed  Welcome to my life, tattoo I'm a man now,  to you I  I'll  you But the skin  man won't get you You'll be  when I die Tattoo  My dad beat me 'cause mine said "Mother" But my  naturally  it and beat my brother 'Cause his  was of a lady in the nude And my  thought that was  rude  Welcome to my life, tattoo We've a long time together, me and you I  I'll  you But the skin  man won't get you You'll be  when I die Tattoo  Now I'm older, I'm  all over My wife is  too A rooty-toot-toot, rooty-tooty-toot-toot Rooty-toot-toot  too To you
