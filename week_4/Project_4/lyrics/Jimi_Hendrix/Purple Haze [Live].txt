Purple haze all in my brain Lately  just don't seem the same Actin' funny, but I don't know why Excuse me  I kiss the sky  Purple haze all around Don't know if I'm comin' up or down Am I  or in misery? Whatever it is that girl put a  on me  Purple haze all in my eyes Don't know if it's day or night You got me blowin', blowin' my mind Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?
