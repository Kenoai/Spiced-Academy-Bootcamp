It's  near dawn, When  close  tired eyes. I'll soon be with you my love, To give you my dawn surprise. I'll be with you  soon, I'll be with you when the  start falling.  I've been  so long To be  I'm going In the  of your love.  I'm with you my love, The light's  through on you. Yes, I'm with you my love, It's the  and just we two. I'll stay with you  now, I'll stay with you till my seas are  up.  I've been  so long To be  I'm going In the  of your love.  I've been  so long To be  I'm going In the  of your love.  I'm with you my love, The light's  through on you. Yes, I'm with you my love, It's the  and just we two. I'll stay with you  now, I'll stay with you till my seas are  up.  I've been  so long I've been  so long I've been  so long To be  I'm going In the  of your love.
