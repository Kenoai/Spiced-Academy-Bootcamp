Every  the  time I lay eyes upon you You don't know how hard it is to let you go Even in the  when we were started I told you man was here to live but he had to go So you  jesus You  Abraham too You  Martin  What you here to do Now we're  play you the feelings That  all left behind Oh you make it hurt so bad Why you make it hurt so bad Take  I had Everything I had Everything I had
