{intro  down  begins} Star  to  ship,  give your position. Over. I'm in  around the  planet from the star  the sun. Over. You mean it's the Earth? Over. Positive. It is  to have some form of  species. Over. I  we  take a look.  {intro  down  ends} Strange  grass of green, With your  silver seas Your  mountains I wish to see closer May I land my  machine? {start  down}  Strange beautiful,  of green With your  silver seas Your  mountains I wish to see closer May I land my  machine? {end  down}  Although your  wonders me, With your  and  cackling hen Your  I do not understand, So to you I  put an end And you'll  hear surf  again {start  down...rough  at lyrics} Secret Oh, secret Oh Shhhh... {end  down}
