Well, it's one for the money, Two for the show, Three to get ready, Now go, cat, go  But don't you step on my blue  shoes You can do  but lay off of my Blue  shoes  Well, you can  me down, Step in my face, Slander my name All over the place  Do  that you want to do, but uh-uh, Honey, lay off of my shoes Don't you step on my Blue  shoes You can do  but lay off of my blue  shoes  You can burn my house, Steal my car, Drink my liquor From an old fruitjar  Do  that you want to do, but uh-uh, Honey, lay off of my shoes Don't you step on my blue  shoes You can do  but lay off of my blue  shoes
