You jump in  of my car when you you know all the time Ninety  an hour, girl, is the  I drive You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a  pain You say you just want me to take you for a drive  You're just like  traffic So hard to get  to you Crosstown traffic I don't need to run over you Crosstown traffic All you do is slow me down And I'm tryin' to get on the  side of town  I'm not the only soul who's  of hit and run Tire  all  your back I can, I can see you had your fun But, darlin' can't you see my  turn from  to red And with you I can see a  jam  up ahead  You're just like  traffic So hard to get  to you Crosstown traffic I don't need to run over you Crosstown traffic All you do is slow me down And I got  things on the  side of town
