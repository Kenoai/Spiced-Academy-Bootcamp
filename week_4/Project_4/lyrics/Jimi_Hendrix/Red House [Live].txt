Ah yeah! There's a red  over yonder, That's  my baby stays Lord, there's a red  over yonder Lord, that's  my baby stays I ain't been home to see my baby In  nine and one half days  Wait a minute, something's  here The key won't  this door Wait a minute, something's wrong, lord, have mercy This key won't  this door, Something's goin' on here I have a bad bad feeling That my baby don't live her no more  Well, I  as well go back over yonder, Way back up on the hill That's  to do Lord, I  as well go back over yonder, Way back  cross the hill 'Cause if my baby don't love me no more I know her  will Yeah
