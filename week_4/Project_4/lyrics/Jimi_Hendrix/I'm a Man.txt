Now when I was a  boy, At the age of five, I had somethin' in my pocket, Keep a lot of  alive.  Now I'm a man, Made twenty-one, You know baby, We can have a lot of fun.  I'm a man, I  M-A-N...man.  All you  women, Stand in line, I can make love to you baby, In an hour's time.  I'm a man, I  M-A-N...man.  I goin' back down, To  to Bring back the  cousin, Little John the conqueroo.  I'm a man, I  M-A-N...man.  The line I shoot, Will  miss, The way I make love to 'em, They can't resist.  I'm a man, I  M-A-N...man.
