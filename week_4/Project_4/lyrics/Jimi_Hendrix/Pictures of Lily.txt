I used to wake up in the morning I used to feel so bad I got so sick of  sleepless nights I went and told my dad  He said, "Son now here's some  something" And  them on my wall And now my  ain't  so lonely In fact I, I don't feel bad at all  Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful Pictures of Lily  me  at night Pictures of Lily  my  problems Pictures of Lily  me feel alright  Pictures of Lily Lily, oh Lily Lily, oh Lily Pictures of Lily  And then one day  weren't  so fine I fell in love with Lily I  my dad  Lily I  find He said, "Son, now don't be silly"  "She's been dead  1929" Oh, how I  that night If only I'd been born in Lily's time It  have been alright  Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful Pictures of Lily  me  at night  For me and Lily are  in my dreams And I ask you, "Hey mister, have you ever seen" "Pictures of Lily?"
