Yeah, sing the song, Bro'   If the sun  to shine  I don't mind, I don't mind  If the  fell in the sea  Let it be, it ain't me  Alright, 'cause I got my own  to look through  And I ain't  copy you   Now if six  out to be nine  I don't mind, I don't mind  Alright, if all the  cut off all  hair  I don't care, I don't care  Dig, 'cause I got my own  to live through  And I ain't  copy you    collared  flashing down the street   their  finger at me.  They're  soon my kind will drop and die  But I'm  wave my  flag high, high  Wave on, wave on  Fall mountains, just don't fall on me  Go  on Mr.  man, you can't  like me  Sing on brother  Play on drummer
