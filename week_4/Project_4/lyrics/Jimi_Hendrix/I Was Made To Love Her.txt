Ah! My baby  me My baby  me And I know I ain't  nowhere I was knee high to a chicken When that love bug bit me I had the  with each  year Oh, even if the  tumbles If this  world crumbles By her side I'll  be  there 'Cause I was made to love her I was made to live for her, yeah! Ah, I was made to love her Built my  all  her Hey, hey, hey Oo baby, I was made to  her You know  ain't  leave her, no Hey, hey, hey Oo wee baby, my baby  me My baby  me Hey, hey, hey Oo my baby  me
