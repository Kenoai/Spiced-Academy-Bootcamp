Only you can make this  seem right Only you can make the  bright Only you and you alone Can  me like you do And fill my  with love for only you  Only you can make this  in me For it's true, you are my destiny When you hold my hand I  the  that you do You're my  come true My one and only you  Only you can make this  in me For it's true, you are my destiny When you hold my hand I  the  that you do You're my  come true My one and only you  (One and only you)
