Oh uh I see fingers,  and  of faces Reachin' up and not  touchin' the  land I hear  and  and a  whisper sayin' Oh, Lord,  give us a helpin' hand Yeah yeah  Way down in the background I can see  souls of  burnin' And all  the water, baby I see  barkin' out the  of death And up in the  I can  UFOs jumpin' themselves Laughin' they sayin' Those  so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess  Back in the  my  mix and  with my drink I can't  tell my feet from the  on the floor But as far as I know, they may even try  To wrap me up in  and try and sell me Brother sell me, and don't  about lookin' at the score Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
