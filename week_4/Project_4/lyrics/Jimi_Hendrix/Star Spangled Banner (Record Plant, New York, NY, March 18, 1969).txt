O say can you see, by the dawn's  light What so  we  at the twilight's last gleaming Whose  stripes and  stars  the  fight O'er the  we watched, were so  streaming? And the  red  and  bursting in air Gave  through the  that our flag was  there O say does that star  banner yet wave For the land of the free And the home of the brave?
