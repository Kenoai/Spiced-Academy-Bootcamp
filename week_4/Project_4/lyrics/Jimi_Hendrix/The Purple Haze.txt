Purple Haze was in my brain lately  don't seem the same actin'  but I don't know why 'scuse me  I kiss the sky  Purple Haze all around, don't know if I'm  up or down Am I  or in misery? Whatever it is, that girl put a  on me  Purple Haze was in my eyes don't know if it's day or night you've got me blowing,  my mind is it  or just the end of time?
