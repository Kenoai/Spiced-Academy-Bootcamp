Honey you do me  but  I'm  about you Stay away too long and I can't do  you Every  you get you seem to hurt me more and more But each hurt  my love  than before I know  go  rain But how can love go  pain  Ain't that peculiar A peculiar-arity Ain't that  baby Peculiar as can be  You tell me lies that  be  to me I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see That  you do and say are  to make me blue It's a  shame my love for you  all Your lies seem true But if the  makes love last longer Why do lies make my love stronger  Ain't that peculiar Peculiar as can be Ain't that  baby A peculiar-arity  I  so much just like a  that's lost its home Maybe baby you  these  I cry are  of joy A  can cry so much  you do  they say But  a  my  don't help me to get my way I know love can last  years But how can love last  tears  Now ain't that  baby A peculiar-arity Ain't it  baby Peculiar as can be  Said I don't  it baby It's so  sometimes
