Once upon a time, you  so fine Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you? People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're  to fall" You  they were all kiddin' you  You used to  about  that was hangin' out Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud About  to be  around for your next meal  How does it feel, how does it feel To be on your own with no  home? Like a  unknown, like a  stone  You've gone to the  school all right, Miss Lonely Don't you know you only used to get  in it? Nobody has ever  you how to live on the street Now you find out you're  have to get used to it  You said you'd  compromise With the  tramp but now you realize He's not  any alibis As you  into the  of his eyes And say,"Do you want to make a deal?"  How does it feel, how does it feel To be  a home, with no  home? Like a  unknown, like a  stone  You  turned  to see the frowns On the  and the clowns When they all came down and did  for you You  understood that it ain't no good You  never let  people get your  for you  You used to ride on the  horse with your diplomat Who  on his  a  cat Ain't it hard when you  that He  wasn't  it's at? After he's  everything he  steal  How does it feel, how does it feel To be  a home, with no  home? Like a  unknown, like a  stone  Princess on the  and all the  people Drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made Exchanging all  gifts and things But take your  ring down and pawn it, babe  You used to be so amused At  in rags and the  that he used Go to him now, he  you, and you can't refuse When you ain't got nothing, you got  to lose You're invisible, you got no  to conceal  How does it feel, how does it feel To be  a home, with no  home? Like a  unknown, like a  stone
