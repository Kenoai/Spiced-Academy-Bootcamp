Hear, hear the  that  so soft and slow That's the  of  fallen snow Your love is gold, your love is gold Seems,  as  we'll be  out here for days To bang upon  drums that we have made You  know, you  know  My one, my only one Lies  in the sun Gave  and so we run Nothing  your  like  become Oh  Stack,  the  wood next to the shed Pile it up so high then  it red, Confuse the dogs,  the dogs And time, time we lost is  on the stairs The  out  the  air And so we go, and so we go  My one, my only one, Lied  to keep me on Gave  and so we sung Everything that ends has  begun  From the  of my mouth And the slow  south It's not to be denied It's not to be denied
