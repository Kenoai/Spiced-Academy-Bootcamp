When the bears They come You won't Have long  You can try And run But you won't Get far  Violence on the streets Violence on the streets, so you're  the walls Spitting out your teeth 'Cause  don't give a f*ck  what you want Bleeding from your feet Bleeding from your feet like a waterfall Violence on the streets Violence on the  everywhere you go  'Cause when the bears They come Well you won't You won't last long
