I keep on  dreams That gravity's a  moon Even in my dream The  distorts the room  I  feeling That  was the wave it seemed It shouldn't be so easy Couldn't stay  green  I have that dream Every time I  wake You were fine Oh The fire So coal How will you find me?  I have that dream Every move We  make Was a gruesome Terror I know it How will you find me? Where will we go?  I used to be so calm I used to be so calm I used to be so calm Are we  off?  Bored,  airplane Fly it to  beach With  and ravens Sitting in the  seat  I'm  tryna  it The  against the  moon Then I kiss you in the hallway Camera obscura  I have that dream Every time I  wake You were fine Oh The fire So coal How will you find me?  I have that dream Every move We  make Was a gruesome Triumph I know it How will you find me? Where will we go?  I used to be so calm I used to be so calm I used to be so calm Are we  off?  Doubt no  what I'm saying Doubt no  how I say it Stubborn to the  I'll take it True love, true love, true love Count it off
