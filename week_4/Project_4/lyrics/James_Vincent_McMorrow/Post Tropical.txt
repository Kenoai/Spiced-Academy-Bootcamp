Will not come home Tepid and cold Crawling  to the fold Trace it by line Light in the ground Beating your  to the sound  No one can look I can  run and the  will  on Tear it into you, loss  it all away Who will run and who will say  All the help  now Learn to be fly  what's left All they sell, got it in me Floating  left in the stream No one can run, I can  walk Move on now,  on Terrible but I'm  it all away No one here I say Forest me, best to give  No one here I say Hold on, hold on
