When the  let go Slowly fade into the  like some  lover On a ship  with ghosts It's  to behold  When the  thin girls With  little  in  hair, They take off  coats and throw Pebbles and  from the side of the boat, Crying out The  they float, the  they float Oh my God, the  they float, the  they float  Down the  ropes Past the  where the  beams meet  skies You make your bed  the moonlight I  it's time we said goodbye  Cause  moves in the warm air And  that once  cut like a knife, They just hang in the  and you're Pushed by the lord, But you're  by the  and You're overboard, you're overboard Oh my God, she's overboard  My love she's overboard She's overboard My love she's over board  Not a  unbroken In the  where my  and the  lay It's not the time to be  around here You know what some  say  That  get too reckless That even with the  of crimes They leave,  behind, As I  the  for the very last time I  she knows, I  she knows Oh my God, I  she knows  I  she knows
