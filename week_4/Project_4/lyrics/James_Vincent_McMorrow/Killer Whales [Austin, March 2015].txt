I make it hard to love me back I know, I know Just  your eyes and hold your breath It won't be long before Just like before,  I  Just like you so  So I take a long way home I call you up Convince you it's  else Somebody sure Cause I'm  in love And I'm not  at night I'm  I  die  leaving a mark Who am I to swim with  whales Who am I to wade to sea They say the less I know the better It  ideal to me Cause I'm not  tragic on the whale There's  things to be Counting my  every day That  immediately  So I take a long way home I call you up Convince you it's  else Somebody sure Cause I'm  in love And I'm not  at night I'm  I  die  leaving a mark  Cause I'm  in love And I'm not  at night I'm  I  die  leaving a mark  Cause I'm  in love And I'm not  at night I'm  I  die  leaving a mark
