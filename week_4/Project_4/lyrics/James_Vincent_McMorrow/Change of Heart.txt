Give me the note Hand it to me I like the weight How  feels  I'm on the team Make me a king Live underwater Surfacing rarely  Raising  sons Ink on a wall Each time I see you Real love is harm  Nags at your feet Conquers the beach Conquers the season Conquers belief  And I have been wrong Too many times To be  a  now To be  to pace around To be  to burden  If you have a  of heart If you have a  of heart If you have a  of heart
