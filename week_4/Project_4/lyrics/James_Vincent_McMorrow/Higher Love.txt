Think  it,  must be  love Down in the  and in the  above, Without it, life is  time. Look  your heart, I'll look  mine  Things look so bad everywhere In this  world, what's fair? We walk  and we try to see Falling  in what  be.  Bring me a  love Bring me a  love, Bring me a  love Where's this  love, I've been  of?  Worlds are turning, we're just  on Facing our fear,  out  alone Oh a yearning, and it's real for me There must be  who's  for me  Things look so bad everywhere In this  world, what's fair? We walk blind, we try to see Falling  in what  be  Bring me a  love Bring me a  love, Bring me a  love Where's this  love, I've been  of?  I will wait for it, I'm not too late for it Until then, I'll sing my song To  the  along  I  light the  up with my soul on fire I  make the sun  from pure desire Let me feel the love come over me Let me feel how  it can be  Bring me a  love Bring me a  love, Bring me a  love I  rise  for this  love.
