I don't like the shit I talk  anymore It  so tired It  untrue I don't know why What I can do  it  I  like I  do Playing along When there's a  outside Got  to prove I'd  not drive When I'm in this mood though  So I  your car into a  lot Stuck it in a fence, I  reversing back You come, you find me and you say this Remember it,  how it felt  Out of my mind, I tell you that I love you Out of your mind, you tell me that you love me too Not  our time  that we  it through Sounds  right,  what we  do Typical,  of me to call Impossible,  for this to work but Out of my mind, I tell you that I love you Out of your mind, you tell me what you want to do Tell me what you want to do Tell me what you want to do  I  ride my  like everyone, day to day 'Cause I'm  like that I got  in my phone The  of my walk, it says  me alone And I will  that you kept on running How come, how come we can't ever be humble?  Maybe we  live in our own  for sure It's good to know, good to know a neighborhood As a person, I have no self-control Remember this,  how it goes  Out of my mind, I tell you that I love you Out of your mind, you tell me that you love me too Not  our time  that we  it through Sounds  right,  what we  do Typical,  of me to call Impossible,  for this to work but Out of my mind, I tell you that I love you Out of your mind, now tell me what you want to do, do, do, do, do Tell me what you want to do, do, do, do, do Tell me what you want to do, do, do, do, do Tell me what you want to do, do, do, do, do ooh, oh-oh, whoa
