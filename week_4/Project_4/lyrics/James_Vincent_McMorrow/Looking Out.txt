Out with the  we sew and the  past that crawls Now, to the  you run  to the girl that's not enough  Shower's looking, now we're  over, I was lucky In the calm the  flip the so, of harlot's. All the same And I hope I'm  in love of course, just doesn't listen  Now, in the  them again In the dawn then we hurry So, I have  to bring and I  that it never  Shower's looking, now we're  over, I was lucky In the calm the  flip the so, of harlot's. All the same And I hope I'm  in love of course, just doesn't listen  You'll be  once, when the fall  to send around When the sun comes, dry  from my eyes So you come  as the  starts to change and you  in. And the best has yet been made
