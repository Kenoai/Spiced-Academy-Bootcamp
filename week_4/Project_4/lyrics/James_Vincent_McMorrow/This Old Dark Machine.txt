Spring it came upon us, Every  filled the air Dropped  wings upon my brother, Cast  shadows on his hair  If we  where they're leading, We will  come before Some  and  magic Made of  to explore  Near the town  we were living Was an old  farm Every year we'd  an orchid In the  of it's arm To  us from the madness Of the  still to come It will be like this forever I will keep you safe from harm  Then they  us in the summer Dressed in  finest clothes You the hat he wore to market I the  filled with holes  I've been  all  hours For a hand as pale as bone That  keep the  sunlight And  the  stone  Near the town  we were living Was a warm and  smell Of the  we had planted Now a  tall and well What a  to our greatness What a  all will tell They'll  us forever They'll  where we fell  This old dark machine, it  and it shudders Pulls to the left, then dies near the gutter But  in the road, the  is silent The  they stare, and then they turn violent If they  touch, the hem of your dress I  rise like a lion,  out again The  they wait, the  they wait By the sign  Near the town  we were living Came a loud and  sound As the  and all her beauty Picked us up from off the ground Carried far  the mountain To a  never bound We will live like this forever I will love you I will love you I will love you
