I will not cave  you For my  is an  tomb I will not  your rest For my  is  blessed  Ever a hard rot Cut from an  cloth of old  Someone is  a bell It  through this  shell That once was my  of birth Now is my  and curse  Heat from the tall lamp Melting the  wax that holds Blood from a deep cut Some of the  stuff to flow  Sometimes my  they don't feel like my own I need  to love I need  to hold
