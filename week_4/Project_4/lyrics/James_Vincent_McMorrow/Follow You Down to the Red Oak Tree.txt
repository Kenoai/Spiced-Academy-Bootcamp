Follow you down to the red oak tree As the air  thick  the  reeds Will you wait for me  until  comes To  me,  me down  See I have not I have not  cold I have  from men who have  from those With  arms so thin and  skin so old But you are young, you are young, you are young  Then  laughs like it's all just for hell As  we  not be  from the  of the well But the  that I make is a  you can sell To pay for the  seeds  Names get  in the red oak tree Of the ones who stay and the ones who leave I will wait for you  with  cindered bones So  me  me down Follow me  me down Follow me  me down Follow me  me down
