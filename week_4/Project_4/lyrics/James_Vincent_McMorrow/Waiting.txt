I cry in my car I cry when I want All I have to do  Is just  about the day  That you told me I'm  sad And you like my look But I talk too much It's just the sky is so damn beautiful I feel like that  another look  But I wasn't nervous And I wasn't angry I was just so  you were here at all Fingers aching Chest wide open  And I feel like you saw me Like I  could see myself When you told me That  wasn't much left to bet So you're  to see when my hope will come back And I'm waiting I'm  waiting  But look at us now We're as big as a house The one we used to  past  And  about the day it  be ours Next time that I was on a plane I'd be  a drink I'm  all I   Was some  light into my veins  But I wasn't nervous From all that dreaming I was just so  I can  at all 'Cause in my  I'm  laughing  And I feel like you saw me Like I  could see myself When you told me That  wasn't much left to bet So you're  to see if my hope will come back And I'm waiting I'm  waiting for you  And I'm sorry If I  showed you enough And you're sorry That I'm  a dime in the rough So we're waiting To see when the  will come next And I'm waiting I'm  waiting
