Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Oh oh oh  We're in it now,  knows What I've become Truth is I  once was sad For what I've done It's like a game  everybody dies And has no fun Still I want to play even if I end Back  I've begun  Because you make me feel alive In  of  water Abandoning my car About a mile from nowhere Because you make me feel alive In  of  water Abandoning my car About a mile from nowhere  Ooh, ooh Mile from nowhere Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Mile from nowhere Ooh, ooh Oh oh oh  What  now? It's your  day It's your  day So  it down Guess we're gone astray Guess we're gone astray I wish I cried It's your  day It's your  day It wasn't mine Guess we're gone astray Guess we're gone astray  Because you make me feel alive In  of  water Abandoning my car About a mile from nowhere Because you make me feel alive In  of  water Abandoning my car About a mile from nowhere  Ooh, ooh Mile from nowhere Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Mile from nowhere Ooh, ooh Oh oh oh  When I wake,  you were gone So I sat at the edge of the lawn Days go by,  no sign of your ghost Never call,  write, it's a loss  Because you make me feel alive In  of  water Abandoning my car About a mile from nowhere Because you make me feel alive In  of  water Abandoning my car About a mile from nowhere You make me feel alive In  of  water Abandoning my car About a mile from nowhere Because you make me feel alive In  of  water Abandoning my car About a mile from nowhere  Ooh, ooh Mile from nowhere Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Mile from nowhere Ooh, ooh Oh oh oh  Mile from nowhere Mile from nowhere Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh
