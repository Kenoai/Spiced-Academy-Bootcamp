Early in the morning, I'll come calling I'll come  after you  Darling if you answer, oh we'll wander Down the  where it's cool  Later we'd discover, all in callings Children  with the stars Early in the morning, in the morning Everything at once is ours  Early in the morning, I'll come calling I'll come  after you  Though you  answer,  I wonder What will pass here when you do  Delicate in grasses,  and ashen Breathing  a ruby nest Early in the morning, in the morning Withered,  we will rest  Early in the morning, in the morning I will call for you Even  the  aren't clear Even if my  seems cruel Early in the morning, in the morning Red and  true  Dressing in my  suit My  shoes Making sure the  are too Crisp and  and blue
