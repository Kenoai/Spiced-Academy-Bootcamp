Don't go out alone I have seen some  things There's a waterfall Quiet  where  can spring Everybody goes Throws  from the top of the stream So don't go out alone 'Cause I have seen some  things  Who  the wall that  the sea? Who  it here  my feet? Who  here for you than me? You let me come I let you lead Open my  you need to be Deep in my  disrupting me What  after  leaves  Back to our horses Back to sleep  Don't go out alone I have seen this  before Where  think they're grown Creatures  they'll  at your door But there's  world A  wave  on a shore So don't go out alone 'Cause I have seen this  before  Who  the wall that  the sea? Who  it here  my feet? Who  here for you than me? You let me come I let you lead Open my  you need to be Deep in my  disrupting me What  after  leaves  Back to our horses Back to sleep  There's a  ahead And I can't feel my legs Check the  in my neck There's a  ahead There's a diamond  Send a car  8 Always  to be late Now I can't look away 'Cause there's a  ahead There's a diamond  Who  the wall that  the sea? Who  it here  my feet? Who  here for you than me? You let me come I let you lead Open my  you need to be Deep in my  disrupting me What  after  leaves?  Back to our horses Back to sleep  Everything is frozen Everything is  I believe Everything is frozen Everything is  I believe Everything is frozen Everything is  I believe Everything is frozen Everything is  I believe
