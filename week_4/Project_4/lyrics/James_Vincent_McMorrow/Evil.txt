So are you good? Cause I don't feel right Are you strong? Cause I'm so damn tired What you want from me? Maybe you  have it Will we ever  the  where this fits me like man  And I  if I'm evil I'll be  down If I'm evil Maybe I had you fooled If I'm evil Still you're  beside me If I'm evil We'll be  down You say it best That it's a long hard track And, I'm a mess Still  than a wreck This used to work for me Now I can  even sing How I feel  myself How this is  like we planned  And I  if I'm evil I'll be  down If I'm evil Maybe I had you fooled If I'm evil Still you're  beside me If I'm evil We'll be  down  You  know your luck You  know the love  saving I've been  all I've got I've been  all I've got away You  know your luck You  know the love  saving I've been  all I've got I've been  all I've got away  And I  if I'm evil I'll be  down If I'm evil Maybe I had you fooled If I'm evil Still you're  beside me If I'm evil We'll be  down  If I'm evil
