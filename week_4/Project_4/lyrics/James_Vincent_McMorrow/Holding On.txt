I'm in that  again You're in here too I  there's  here They seem confused Don't take  so literally This isn't  a field More like a  representation of Who  it once last year  How do I die? How do I die? Somebody here knows How do I die? How do I die? Somebody here's withholding  Information Information From me and my father Information Information From me and my partners  So I buy a house I buy a house Fill it with animals I buy a house I buy a house Fill it with gold expenses  You call me up You call me up And we go out sometimes You call me up You call me up And then you realize  That I  too much Or not enough Can't get the  right I  too much Or not enough It  me up at night  I  food Pomegranates Not my  fruit I wait in line I wait in line Wait in line Wait in line  I  in  on I  in  on
