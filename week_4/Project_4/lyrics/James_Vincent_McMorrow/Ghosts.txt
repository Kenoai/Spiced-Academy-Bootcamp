The moon  the light And the moon's this  globe Shedding  upon the road The bird won't fly And a bird  its  is a low and  thing  We are ghosts We are  amongst  hills From the  of  green To the  beneath our feet We are ghosts We are  amongst  hills Pressing out  the shore Pressing out  the shore  The  song That is now the  of thirds And it's only to be heard And  I'm gone I will come  in spring When the  can begin  We are ghosts We are  amongst  hills From the  of  green To the  beneath our feet We are ghosts We are  amongst  hills Pressing out  the shore Pressing out  the shore
