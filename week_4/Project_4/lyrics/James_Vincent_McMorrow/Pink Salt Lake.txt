As long As I'm  for you Please say it Or I'm lost some way  Doubt A  theme for me Remain here Like a. pink salt lake  Oh, to  everything Then wait While the warmth, it drifts  Through so So many  alarms That breathe Moves in  grip  If time is inevitable How  you  me alone? If time is inevitable How can you  me alone? If time is inevitable How  you  me alone? If time is inevitable If time is inevitable  Do I keep you up? Never mean to, my love It's just nobody's  sure How is  really sure?  Do I keep you up? Never mean to, my love It's just nobody's  sure How is  really sure?
