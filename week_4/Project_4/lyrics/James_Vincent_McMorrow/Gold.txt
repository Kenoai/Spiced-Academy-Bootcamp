How was the cold Along the path I  to hold Although it  round a  wing Blinded by hot gas and  off steam There was  smoke  Burnt in the grass Reclaim a  of  south Add in the  and long lost fatigue Barrels that hide us in hair  heed Then  sound  I wasn't  a love  Covered up in hard  clay I wasn't  a stop Always in it so much more I wasn't  a love Covered up in hard  clay Time wasn't the only    I hope my  charts show up via rivers Out to the only ocean There's  peaceful that goes out via river Out to the ocean I was  standing, I was open  I wasn't  a love Covered up in hard  clay I wasn't  a stop Always in it so much more I wasn't  a love Covered up in hard  clay  Time wasn't the only cavernous Time wasn't the only cavernous Time wasn't the only cavernous Time wasn't the only coward
