I don't want to live  your love I had let it go to waste I don't want to live  your love Drag it to an open window Shred it in a  pieces I don't want to live  your love Funny how we do  everything we  away Only in  when it's cold do we miss the warmth Every  ever opened Take  of the summer  Cause if you're alone, if you're alone How can I save you? I find a way to make your love more complicated What if I  change, if I  change if you  save me? So find a way to miss a  times  I don't want to live  your love Oh, oh I tell you what you want to hear if What you want is incomplete I don't want to live  your love I've been  what to  if I can look the  way I seem to  how it felt to be  by something Walk  you see no water Just in case it doesn't appear Take  of the summer  Cause if you're alone, if you're alone How can I save you? I find a way to make your love more complicated What if I  change, if I  change if you  save me? So find a way to miss a  times  And I  just sit in my car Listening to  alarms go They seem far, so far, so Feeling the  of the world Nothing  to the long road That  hard, so hard, so And I  just sit in my car Listening to  alarms go They seem far, so far, so Feeling the  of the world It's  compared to the long road That  hard, so hard, so  Cause if you're alone, if you're alone How can I save you? I find a way to make your love more complicated What if I  change, if I  change if you  save me? So find a way to miss a  times
