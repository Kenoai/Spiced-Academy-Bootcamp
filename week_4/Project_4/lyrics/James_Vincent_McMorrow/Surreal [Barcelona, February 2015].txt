Tell me come over Then  in to read And say it can wait But I'm so unstable That I  to leave Still  this cage I have  in corpses Warmth on  lips As  of life I have  their voices Hard to resist Even when they lie They're  talking Telling me I run Like I don't Read the signs Some are  drums Staying low but Holding time Show me something Surreal Your new lover On fire In the night In the night Are you hopeless Like me Then you'll notice Those fires In the night In the night Why can we never Say the  we mean Before it's too late I've got some secrets I  to keep Down to my grave â€˜Cause i have  a fortress Failures and bricks Underneath the ice You have come And  your palm on my wrist Dragged me in the light Now i'm hoping I will be enough To behold For a time I  even trust With control Who relies Show me something Surreal Your new lover On fire In the night In the night Are you hopeless Like me Then you'll notice Those fires In the night In the night In the night Beg for it, Beg for it here I'm nervous That I'm insincere Beg for it Beg for it here Show me something Surreal Your new lover On fire In the night In the night Are you hopeless Like me Then you'll notice Those fires In the night In the night In the night
