Are you learning Like I  you? Retreads only Don't reveal Truth  Snow kept pushing You kept laughing Do you love me Like I love you?  'Cause I don't want to wait forever, no I don't want to wait I don't want to wait forever, no I don't want to wait  Carving out a gate forever, no I don't want to wait  Abacus and wait forever, no I don't want to wait  Take me in  the arms Of a swan With a ghost Deep  their body Oh You and I You and I
