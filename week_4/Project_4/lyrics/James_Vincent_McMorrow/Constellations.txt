The  broke it's back There was  we  do  it Boys  like me fine Exacting what love means Distance made Catching trains Left you  alone  But baby you feel everything And there's  we  can do  it I try and make you laugh As a fire  in June Tired to death You hold me  and say How do we go on? How do we go on? How do we go on? How do we go on? How do we go? How do we go?  Then you find a way To be separate To  in  ways That's  and safe Doesn't need to be your heart Can be any  part Of your body  through stone Then I miss the  you form Into  constellations Into  outer space How do we go on? How do we go on? How do we go on? How do we go on? How do we go?
