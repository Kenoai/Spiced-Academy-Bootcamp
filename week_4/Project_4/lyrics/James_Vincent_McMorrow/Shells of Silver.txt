When the cold of the day is over And the  of the  moves in There's a  that  beneath my skin So I try to stay warm and moving But the  is just too strong As the  of a rose is  and long Shells of  (silver) Shells of  (silver) Shells of   This  strange As the  we get to the grave This  strange As the  we get to the grave This  strange As the  we get to the grave This  strange As the  we get to the grave Everybody  love,  but it's not enough To have a good heart,  but it's not enough.
