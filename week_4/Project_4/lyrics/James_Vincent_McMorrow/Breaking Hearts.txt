You can stop your crying, I'm  coming back You can stop your crying, just walk down the  again I just can't take the pressure, it's all too much for me I just can't take the pressure,  just let me be  See I've been,  hearts, for far too long Loving you, for far too long, Making  now, for far too long Yes I've been  hearts, for far too long Loving you, for far too long, It's time I leave, it's time I'm  on.  I'm  find a city, call the  my own I'm  find a city,  until it's gone The  there, look so pretty,  me oh so well The  there look so pretty, they're all just  shells to me  See I've been,  hearts, for far too long Loving you, for far too long, Making  now, for far too long Yes I've been  hearts, for far too long Loving you, for far too long, It's time I leave, it's time I'm  on.  When I need the shelter, I'll know just who to call When I need the shelter,  on your door But when it  to dying, I'll do it on my own I've  been too clever, I've  just hung on.  See I've been,  hearts, for far too long Loving you, for far too long, Making  now, for far too long Yes I've been  hearts, for far too long Loving you, for far too long, It's time I leave, it's time I'm  on.
