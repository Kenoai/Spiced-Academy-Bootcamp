Hello I've  here for you Everlong  Tonight I  myself in two Out of the red Out of her head she sang  Come down and  away with me Down with me Slow, how you  it to be I'm over my head Out of her head she sang  And I wonder When I sing  with you If  could ever feel this real forever If  could ever be this good again The only  I'll ever ask of you You've got to  not to stop when I say when She sang  Breathe out So I can  you in Hold you in And now I know you've  been Out of your head Out of my head I sang  And I wonder When I sing  with you If  could ever feel this real forever If  could ever be this good again The only  I'll ever ask of you You've got to  not to stop when I say when She sang  And I wonder If  could ever feel this real forever If  could ever be this good again The only  I'll ever ask of you You've got to  not to stop when I say when
