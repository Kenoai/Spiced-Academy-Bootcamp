Yes or no? What is truth But a  black  coming out of the blue? I was wrong I was right I'm a  moon born in the dead of night  Break my bones I don't care All I ever  was a body to share Heart's gone cold Brush ran dry Satellite  for a sign of life Like you  Somewhere? Are you there?  The  in your eyes Someday will dry We  for our lives 'Cause everything's on the line This time  Listen close I can't hide I'm a page torn from a  spine Sun gets low I get high Satellite  for a sign of life Like you  Somewhere? Are you there? The  in your eyes Someday will dry We  for our lives 'Cause everything's on the line This time  Are you there? Are you there?  The  in your eyes Someday will dry We  for our lives 'Cause everything's on the line This time  The  in your eyes Someday will dry We  for our lives 'Cause everything's on the line  Yes or no? What is truth But a  black  coming out of the blue I was wrong I was right I'm a  moon born in the dead of night
