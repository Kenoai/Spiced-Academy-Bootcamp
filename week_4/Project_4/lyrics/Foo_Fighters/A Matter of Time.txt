Ooh, ooh Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh Where the hell are you?  It's just a  of time before, before It's just a  of time before, before And  I hate to  before, before It's just a  of time  What does it  now? What does it  now? What does it  now? What does it  now? It's just a  of time Time
