These are my  last words My number's up  will burn Oh won't you let me  your fate It's  kinda late  And I don't  wait no more Oh may I have this  of days Locked in your embrace You  your test of faith  Another time,  place,  line upon your face Another in your wake Down  stairs and  glances  the king of  chances Now  him in the flames  Whatever  you warm at  (whatever  you warm at night) Whatever  you warm inside Your  are  now They're all  down It's all  'round  You're  them down It's all  'round They're all  down Your  are  now  Oh let me put you in your place Love it when you say, I'm  everything away, but Tell me what's in it for me  Tell me now what's in it for me No one's  this for free So tell me now what's in it for me Whatever  you warm at  (whatever  you warm at night)  Whatever  you warm inside Your  are  now They're all  down It's all  'round  You're  them down It's all  'round They're all  down Your  are  now  Gathering the ashes Everything  away Gathering the ashes Scatter as they blow away  Gathering the ashes Everything  away Gathering the ashes Scatter as they blow away  Your  are  now They're all  down It's all  'round  You're  them down It's all  'round They're all  down  Your  are  now (Gather in the ashes) They're all  down (Everything  away) It's all  'round (Scatter as they blow away)  You're  them down (Gather in the ashes) It's all  'round (Everything  away) They're all  down (Gather in the ashes) Your  are  now (Scatter as they blow away)
