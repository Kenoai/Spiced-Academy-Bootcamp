I've been  dirty water But I've been here before,  all The  hour is upon us So you and I can sing  songs  In my  I'm  ladders And then I  down, rung by rung And I keep on  faster The  is echoing, on and on On and on  I feel an  coming on I feel the  in my bones I'm a  disaster You're the  after all my storms  You're my sea of  flowers Standing in the sun, row by row I've been  dirty water The  of  revenge, best  cold All we know  I feel an  coming on I feel the  in my bones I'm a  disaster And you're the  after all my storms  Bleed  water,  dirty sky Bleed  water,  dirty sky Bleed  water,  dirty sky Bleed  water,  dirty sky Bleed  water,  dirty sky Bleed  water,  dirty sky  I feel an  coming on I feel the  in my bones 'Cause I'm a  disaster Dirty  in my blood  I feel a  coming on Heavy  in my bones 'Cause I'm a  disaster You're the  after all my storms
