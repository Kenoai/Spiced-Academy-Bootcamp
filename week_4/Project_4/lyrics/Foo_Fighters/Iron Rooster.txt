Have you ever been dumb  to do what you  to do Without good  coming over you? Have you ever been  enough to feel what you  to feel? Take back  years for  real  I'm an iron rooster Cold and still Irregular sculpture Held  my will  Have you ever been  enough to say what you  to say Without no  getting in the way? Have you ever been in love  to be who you  to be? I won't mind you if you won't mind me  I'm an iron rooster Cold and still Irregular sculpture Held  my will  Can you  we're older? I won't  it's over now Do you  being children? Do you  when? Now  I'm an iron rooster Cold and still Irregular sculpture An iron rooster Cold and still Irregular sculpture An iron rooster Held  my will
