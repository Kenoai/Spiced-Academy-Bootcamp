Took the high dive into your brain And you made your  calls You just  wear your  out If you don’t let it go  There’s  that you couldn’t say 'Cause you’ve said it all before I  it’s time you  this  road All on your own  It’s your cold day in the sun Looks like your  heart has  won  I wish I  take it away And save you from yourself You get so lost  your head  like no one else  Looking for  to blame? Did you  me all along? You’ll take the heat But you  never take the fall  It’s your cold day in the sun Looks like your  heart has  won  You’re so  that you are the only one that you are the only one You know Don’t be  because you’re not the only one You’re not the only one I know  It’s your cold day in the sun Looks like your  heart has  won It’s your cold day in the sun Looks like your  heart has  won
