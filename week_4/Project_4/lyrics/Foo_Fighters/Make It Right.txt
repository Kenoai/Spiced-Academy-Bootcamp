Everybody needs,  needs Needs a  suffer I just  do, I just  do Do a  number Bite the hand that feeds, bite the hand that feeds Bite a  harder What's it  take, what's it  take Gonna take a lover  Hop on the  to  baby Don't you  hitch a ride? Lights go out and your head  spinning Someone got you hypnotized Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo Brother can you  a dime? Count what's left when it's all gone wrong How you  make it right? How you  make it right?  Everybody breathe,  breathe Breathe a  deeper Got no soul to keep, got no soul to keep Ain't no brother's keeper I don't fuckin' need, I don't fuckin' need I don't need a matyr Who's it  be? Who's it  be? Gonna be another  Hop on the  to  baby Don't you  hitch a ride? Lights go out and your head  spinning Someone got you hypnotized Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo Brother can you  a dime? Count what's left when it's all gone wrong How you  make it right? How you  make it right? Gonna make it right How you  make it right? Gonna make it right  Hop on the  to  baby Don't you  hitch a ride? Lights go out and your head  spinning Someone got you hypnotized Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo Brother can you  a dime? Count what's left when it's all gone wrong How you  make it right? How you  make it right? How you  make it right? Gonna make it right Gonna make it right
