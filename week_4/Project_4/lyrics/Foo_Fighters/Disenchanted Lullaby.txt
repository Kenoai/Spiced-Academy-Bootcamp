Disenchanted Lullaby Sing me yours, I'll sing you mine Sing with me now what's a boy to do? What's a boy to do? Sing  for yesterday Sing  my soul today Sing  another song for you What's a boy to do?  I may be scattered A  shattered What does it matter No one has a fit like I do  I may be scattered A  shattered What does it matter? No one has a fit like I do I'm the only one that's fits you  Whispering to pass the time Whisper for the days gone by Whisper with the  inside of you With this ring you will be mine With this ring I'll multiply With this ring  to you What's a boy to do?
