Real life is so hard We hide in the stars That's  our  are My head and your heart  This is a blackout Don't let it go to waste This is a blackout I want to detonate  When you are so far I'm  part Lose all my sonar You jam my radar  This is a blackout Don't let it go to waste This is a blackout I want to detonate  Sometimes I feel I'm  stuck Between the  and the f*ck You've got me on guard I've got my head start My head and your heart The same in the stars  This is a blackout Don't let it go to waste This is a blackout I want to detonate  Sometimes I feel I'm  stuck Between the  and the f*ck Brain, brain, brain, brain Okay
