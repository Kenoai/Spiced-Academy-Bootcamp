You lost your mind I  not go What  time we spent A  on the floor  My desperation A  top Revolving on and on A  that  stops  Is it all mine? How  I know? We  the rind away Swallowed all the core  Tried levitation You're not alone The  are  open A door we'll  close  I have an  made of gold Something so beautiful The  will  know Our  are  than you know Up  the  we will grow  Is it all mine? I can't let go What  time we spent A  on the floor My desparation Is this a curse? 'Til  do us part For  or for worse  I have an  made of gold Something so beautiful The  will  know  Our  are  than you know Up  the  we will grow Our  are  than you know Up  the  we will grow
