Tonight I'm  in my  of clouds Dreaming aloud  Things just won't do  you,  of fact Oh oh ooh I'm on your back I'm on your back Oh oh ooh I'm on your back  If you'd  surrender, I'll give up some more Weren't you adored  I  be  you,  of fact Oh oh ooh I'm on your back  If you walk out on me I'm  after you If you walk out on me I'm  after you  Another  is  in two I'm on your back  I  be  you,  of fact Oh oh ooh I'm on your back I'm on your back Oh oh ooh I'm on your back  If you walk out on me I'm  after you If you walk out on me I'm  after you If you walk out on me I'm  after you
