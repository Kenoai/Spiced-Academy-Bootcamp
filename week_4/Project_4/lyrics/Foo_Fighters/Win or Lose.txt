I'm hangin' around, I not puttin' down the  I'm in  I've  been proud, And now I'm  to shed my skin   I'm  away, I know if I stay I'll sit and spin.  Imagine the day, I'm  if they can reel me in  Pick up  I left off   Lets make a bet  We'll make a  and call this   Let's make a bet  I'm in loss and win or lose with you   I see it all now, I'm  my bow in   Comes  around, Its  too loud the  I'm in   So now I can leave, two  of me some   The one that relieves, the  disease like   Pick up  I left off   Lets make a bet  We'll make a  and call this   Let's make a bet  I'm in loss and win or lose   Speakin' in  I can't get   Think of runnin' but  I'm  of runnin' into you  Speakin' in  the way I do  Found that you  quite well  Cause that's your  too   I'm hangin' around, I'm not puttin' down the  I'm in  In love with the sound, its gettin' too loud
