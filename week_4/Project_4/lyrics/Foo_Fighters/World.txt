When all is said and done And the air we  is not enough To keep  broken  floating Carry on into the sun, into the sun  On into the sun On into the sun  Looking down at you, sleeping From above, I love Looking down at you, weeping From above, I love  Over and over again I ride the  that turns Over and over again I find the soul that burns And if it has no end The  heart that learns Over and over again I ride the  that turns  When all is dead and gone And the air we  is not enough To keep  dying arms, see them Carry on into the sun, into the sun  I'm not the only one I'm not the only one  Heaven  are reeling And my hand that  the world Deep  I'm reaching Into the universe  Over and over again I ride the  that turns Over and over again I find the soul that burns And if it has no end The  heart that learns Over and over again I ride the  that turns  Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh  Over and over again I ride the  that turns Over and over again I find the soul that burns And if it has no end The  heart that learns Over and over again I ride the  that turns  Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh  Over and over again I ride the  that turns Over and over again I find the soul that burns
