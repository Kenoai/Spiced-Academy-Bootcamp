Some  are born Made to wave the flag, Oh, they're red, whit and blue. And when the band  "Hail to the chief", They  the  right at you.  It ain't me, It ain't me. I ain't no senator's son. It ain't me, It ain't me. I ain't no  one.  Some  are born Silver  in hand, Lord don't they help themselves. But when the tax man  to the door, Lord, the  looks like a  sale.  It ain't me, It ain't me. I ain't no millionaire's son. It ain't me, It ain't me. I ain't no  one.  Some  inherit Star  eyes, Ooh, they send you down to war. And when you ask them, "How much  we give?" They only  "More! More! More!"  It ain't me, It ain't me. I ain't no  son. It ain't me, It ain't me. I ain't no  one.  It ain't me, It ain't me. I ain't no  Son.
