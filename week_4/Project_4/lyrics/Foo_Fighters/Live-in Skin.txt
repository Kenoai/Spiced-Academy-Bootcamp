Take your payroll And your lottery There's a  I know There's a robbery  And I  I'll  tell If you  you'll  tell And we'll all make out so well We will all make out so well  Head on with my hate Into the  ahead I'm  that I'm  standing And I  that we all  in I'm amounted  Just the same old Glitter story From the sea floor Metamorphosis And I can't  back for you I will not  back for you I must live in skin that's new I'm a  skin that's new  Head on with my hate Into the  ahead I'm  that I'm  standing And I  that we all  in I'm amounted  Turn your  out to the outside Turn the  in to the inside Trade your  in for the inside Turn it  again Turn your  out to the outside Turn the  in to the inside Trade your  in for the inside Turn it  again  I'm amounted  And I can't  back for you No I can't  back for you
