There's a  I'd love to go, Strangers they can meet there, Dream  the day I  to fly. I'm  of airaplains, Even  I like  wings, Fears to be a  in the sky.  It's alright. And it's good this time.  I look out and on the ground, Really don't  it, Gravity can pull me from this hight. One day we'll come  down, What will I do, Never had a  to say goodbye. Close my eyes and hope that it's a real  flight this time. Close my eyes and hope that it's a real  flight, And it's good this time. I  down out on the ground, I  down out on the ground, I  down out on the ground, I look out we're  down.
