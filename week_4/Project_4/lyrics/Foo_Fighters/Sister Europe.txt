Stupid on the Steinway So sick upon a Steinway The  drown  See them talk and see them drown And see them  and fall around Upon the floor  Sister of mine, home again Sister of mine, home again  Lonely in a  room The  plays out of tune So silently  The  upon the floor Is  it  aznavour So out of key  Sister of mine, home again Sister of mine, home again  Broken on a ship of fools Even  must fall to rules So stupidly  Words are all just  sound Just like  they fall around And we will be  Sister of mine, home again Sister of mine, home again  Buy a car and  it rust Sister see them fall to dust They fall around  In  crowded room Paint me like the  I'm in Honestly  Sister of mine, home again Sister of mine, home again  Sister of mine Sister of mine Sister of mine Sister of mine Sister.
