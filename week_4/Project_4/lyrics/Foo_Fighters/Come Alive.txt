Seems like only yesterday Life  to runaways Nothing here to see No  back Every  monotone Every  monochrome Light  to fade Into the black  Such a  animal Sterilized with alcohol I  hardly Feel me anymore  Desperate and meaningless All  up with emptiness Felt like everything Was said and done  I lay  in the dark And I  my eyes You  me the day You came alive  Still I  to find my way Spinning now was end of days Burning like a flame Behind my eyes  Drown it out Drink it in Crown the king of suffering Prisoner,  to the disguise  Disappear the only thing Bittersweet surrendering Knew that it was time To say goodbye  I lay  in the dark And I  my eyes You  me the day You came alive No  left Me to survive You  me The day you came alive  Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive  Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive  I lay  in the dark And I  my eyes You  me the day You came alive  Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive  Nothing  to give I can  live Come alive Your life into me I can  breathe Come alive  Lay me down in the dark Open my eyes You  me The day you came alive  Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive Come alive
