Once upon a time I was  else In  life I saw myself Way back then, back when I was new  Somewhere down the line I  to slip Years gone by,  my lip All the while, all this time I knew  Now you're on your own, one for the pages Over the hill and  the ages Does my  burn like hell on you?  Out  the  they're  in waves Rolling like an  under the pavement Where are they now, tell me Mr. True You got a lot of nerve,  nerve  Now show a  backbone why don't you? I'm  for some back and  with you Are you  the same as I do? Now and now and then I'm  for some back and  with you Are you  the same as I do? Down and out  Holding my breath, I  and waited How'd this  life get so complicated? Shoes to fill,  to  down you Deer in the headlight,  in the wheel You all pretend, I need for real Taking it back, all my IOUs You got a lot of nerve, nerve  Now show a  backbone why don't you? I'm  for some back and  with you Are you  the same as I do? Now and now and then I'm  for some back and  with you Are you  the same as I do? Down and out  You got a lot of nerve, nerve, nerve, nerve  Now show a  backbone why don't you? I'm  for some back and  with you Are you  the same as I do? Now and now and then I'm  for some back and  with you Are you  the same as I do? Now and now and then  I'm lookin' for some back and  with you Are you feelin' the same as I do down and out
