Got my good side at the ready If the  one is on the mend Feel it in my  when you  my back Break it just to  me bend Anyway for once you  it No  what your good book says Never lookin' back 'cause I ain't no saint Just  teenage head  You gotta, wait for the  and you wait for the feeling And you wait, and you  and you shake Crawlin' back and  from the  and white  Over and over again Over and over and over again Ain't no  back  I'm walkin' a line,  Walkin' a line, walkin' a line For you  Maybe if you  you'll save me Maybe save  instead Swear  my  and I hope to die Maybe we  just play dead Runnin' out of time but I'm ready Run out when I run this red See you on the chase, I will  you down Even  you're  ahead  You gotta, wait for the  and you wait for the feeling And you wait, and you  and you shake Crawlin' back and  from the  and white  Over and over again Over and over and over again Ain't no  back no  ain't no  back, No  ain't no  back, no  ain't no  back Ain't no  back 'cause I'm walkin' a line Walkin' a line for you
