Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay Every  leads me away Pray for tomorrow, but for today All I want, is to be home  Stand in the mirror, you look the same Just  for shelter, from the cold and the pain Someone to cover, safe from the rain And all I want, is to be home  The  and silence,  and grace And all of  moments I'll  replace Fear of my  absence of faith All I want, is to be home  All I want, is to be home  People I've loved, have no regrets Some  remember, some  forget Some of them livin', some of them dead All I want, is to be home
