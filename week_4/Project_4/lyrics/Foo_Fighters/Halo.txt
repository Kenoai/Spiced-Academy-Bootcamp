Good and bad  I  I've had them both, they're   But is it fun  When you get hold of one  Some gone bad  And some gone back  Good ones all get  I'm callin'   You ain't  enough   Wait and pray you'll pick on me  the day I  my hand  Guess that I've been nice but I'll be    Halo  God only   Right  me  I go  Halo  God only   Right  me  I go   Say your  when you get   Pray you're  make it  And then when you're done  You keep  up  One day soon I'll   And if you'll come I'll take you  to go  To keep from  old   Wait and pray you'll pick on me  the day I  my hand  Guess that I've been nice but I'll be    Halo  God only   Right  me  I go  Halo  God only   Right  me  I go  Oh, oh, oh   Disappear, the  is   Disappear,  their rage  Disappear, I'm  of   Disappear  we get away  Halo  God only   Right  me  I go  Halo  God only   Right  me  I go  oh, oh oh
