Everyone  one mistake One more time for old  sake One more time  the  fades  One that's born of memories One more  you gave to me One more test just how much can I take  Because you're not the one but you're the only one Who can make me feel like this You're not the one but you're the only one  Who can make me feel like shit  Something  meant to be Everything you  to me Wake me when this  is done  Those who try and get away From the one who gets away Someone's  someone else's one  Because you're not the one but you're the only one Who can make me feel like this You're not the one but you're the only one  Who can make me feel like shit You're not the one but you're the only one Who can make me feel like this You're not the one but you're the only one  Who can make me feel like shit  Until the end of time In  life Until the day I die Save it up for one more try Save it for the last goodbye We go on and get off And get on and get off  Because you're not the one but you're the only one Who can make me feel like this You're not the one but you're the only one  Who can make me feel like shit You're not the one but you're the only one Who can make me feel like this You're not the one but you're the only one  Who can make me feel like shit  Because you're not the one but you're the only one Who can make me feel like this You're not the one but you're the only one  Who can make me feel like Oh shit
