On a  ceiling I can't explain  I need  at midnight But it ain't no cure Medicine at  calling But it ain't no cure I may be sick but you know I'm yours  I  dancing hard  the dead moon Howling with you howling  Ever get the  nothing else will do I  hear you singing I can't explain  I need  at midnight But it ain't no cure Medicine at  howling But it ain't no cure I may be sick but you know I'm yours  Rain on the  floor, back  the ropes Rain on the  floor, back  the ropes Rain on the  floor, back  the ropes Rain on the  floor, back  the ropes Rain on the  floor, back  the ropes  Medicine at midnight But it ain't no cure Medicine at  howling But it ain't no cure I may be sick but you know I'm yours  Rain on the  floor, back  the ropes Rain on the  floor, back  the ropes
