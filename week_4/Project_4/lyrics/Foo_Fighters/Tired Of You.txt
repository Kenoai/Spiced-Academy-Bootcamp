I can be your liar I can be your  of bad news Sick and  by The  in your fire Burning like a  inside of you But is this just  or the truth?  So  on me for the ruse Shame on me for the blues Another one  that I'll  use  I won't go  tired of you I won't go  tired of you I'm not  tired I won't go  tired of you I won't go  tired of you I'm not  tired  Hanging on this wire Waiting for the day I have to choose Cursed by love so dire One more boy for hire One more boy to lend a hand to you But it is this just  or the truth?  So  on me for the ruse Shame on me for the blues Another one  that I'll  use  I won't go  tired of you I won't go  tired of you I'm not  tired I won't go  tired of you I won't go  tired of you I'm not  tired Of you Of you  I can be your liar I can be your  of bad news Sick and  by The  in your fire Burning like a  inside of you Is this just  or the truth?  So  on me for the ruse Shame on me for the blues Another one  that I'll  use  I won't go  tired of you I won't go  tired of you I'm not  tired I won't go  tired of you I won't go  tired of you I'm not  tired Of you
