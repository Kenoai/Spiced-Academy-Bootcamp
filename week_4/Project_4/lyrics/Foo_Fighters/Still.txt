If you'd like to walk a while We  waste the day Follow me into the trees I will lead the way  Bring some  up to the bridge Bring some alcohol There we'll make a  wish Just  the fall  Promise I will be  yours Promise not to say  word Never mind what's done is done Always was a  one  Watch the  all alone Sitting on the tracks Hear the  come  in Never  back  Laying  in the grass Everything is still River  and  bones Scattered on the hill  Promise I will be  yours Promise not to say  word Never mind what's done is done Always was a  one  Promise I will be  yours Promise not to say  word Here  deep  the dirt Never mind what's done is done Always was a  one
