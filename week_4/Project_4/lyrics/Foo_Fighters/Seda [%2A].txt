Seda can you hear me Do you know my face Perfect like a circle Gone  a trace  So long I have  you Marks upon your skin I can  everything Can you  this  Seda doesn't care She just sits and stares All the  bare for the  to see  Who will  before you If you don't say my name Safe to say we will  know We are both the same  I don't mind I can  find you Waiting  for me  Seda doesn't care She just sits and stares All her  bare for the  to see  Seda doesn't care She just sits and stares Seda doesn't care She's just dyin' there Seda doesn't care She's just lyin' there All the  bare for you and me
