I  it to the mailman I'm  against a pot plant I'm sick of all the sun-tan Oily with the ray-ban  Take that to the bank and call it a check Masked  a weapon  I'm  as a spit pan Dealing with the shit plan Playing with my bad hand Just  rock band  Take that to the man and call it a check Trapped  a contract  Hey  boy  you were  the  widow The rest of us were  Melrose  I  swim in the wattershed I  listen to the flowerhead I lost a  and  I bled I keep on  I get ahead  Pissed at all the disc jam Pissed  the 5-ham Pissed  the  state I miss it and I can't wait  Hey man can't you tell it's  a problem? See you at the devil's tower  I  swim in the wattershed I  listen to the flowerhead I lost a  and  I bled I keep on  I get ahead  Pissed at all the disc jam Pissed  the 5-ham Pissed  the  state I miss it and I can't wait
