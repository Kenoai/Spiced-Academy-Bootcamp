A  miles away Your  in the distance To whom it may concern I  I lost my way Getting good at  over Every time that I return  Learning to walk again I  I've  long enough Where do I begin? Learning to talk again Can't you see I've  long enough? Where do I begin?  Do you  the days? We  these  mountains Then sat and  them burn I  I  my place Can't you feel it  stronger Little conquerors  Learning to walk again I  I've  long enough Where do I begin? Learning to talk again I  I've  long enough Where do I begin?  Now, For the very  time Don't you pay no mind Set me free, again To keep alive, a  at a time That's  inside, a  to a riot The sacrifice, the  to survive The  decline,  state of mind I'm on my knees, I'm  for a sign Forever, whenever, I  wanna die  I  wanna die I  wanna die I'm on my knees, I  wanna die I'm  on my grave I'm  through the fire Forever, whenever I  wanna die I  wanna leave I'll  say goodbye Forever, whenever Forever, whenever  Learning to walk again I  I've  long enough Where do I begin? Learning to talk again Can't you see I've  long enough? Where do I begin?  Learning to walk again I  I've  long enough Learning to talk again Can't you see I've  long enough?
