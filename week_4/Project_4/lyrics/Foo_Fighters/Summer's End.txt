Early  without warning Woke me with a scare I had that  again That the sun was dead Make me warm or take me home It's so cold in here Can't we meet somewhere Is it  there? Is it  there? This winter  Meet me in the  time We can move the air Sweet  countryside I will meet you there Bloody lips and  wine Moonshine in your hair Just keep  at the sun Pray for summer's end  Come on over  my storm Ocean's overhead Come  my friend Getting bad out there Every  we have stolen All we had to share No one  this But you know I did You know I did This moment  Meet me in the  time We can move the air Sweet  countryside I will meet you there Bloody lips and  wine Moonshine in your hair Just keep  at the sun Pray for summer's end  Meet me in the  time We can move the air Sweet  countryside I will meet you there Bloody lips and  wine Moonshine in your hair Just keep  at the sun Pray for summer's end
