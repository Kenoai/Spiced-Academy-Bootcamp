Chasing  to get high My head is in the clouds Chasing  to get by I'm  coming down  My  is six feet underground The road to hell is  with good intentions Dark  of mine The road to hell is  with  parts Bleeding  like mine  Chasing  through the sky And deep into the black Chasing birds, say goodbye I'm  coming back  Here  another  attack The road to hell is  with good intentions Dark  of mine The road to hell is  with  parts Bleeding  like mine  Chasing  to get high I'm  coming down  My  is six feet underground The road to hell is  with good intentions Dark  of mine The road to hell is  with  parts Bleeding  like mine  Chasing birds Chasing birds Chasing birds Chasing birds Chasing birds Chasing birds
