The  that I got onto up and left that town Threw it up as it went down Strange  it left me rude and  around Watched as they all took  vows  Fools were  trying to save that day I don't  that anyway  Phase it out  the  ones return Have a seat and  it burn Trace  the  this is what I've learned Always  for my turn
