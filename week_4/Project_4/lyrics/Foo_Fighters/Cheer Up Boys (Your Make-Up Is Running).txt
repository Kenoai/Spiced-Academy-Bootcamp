It was  to be But all  it  meant a thing Never  to ask you why You didn't pass me by  Did you see me in your life? Flash  your eyes Was it just that I wasn't hard enough Hard  for you  Stop  my Confusion Wait, wait  There's a  out there (There's a  out there) Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)  Give me one last wish (Give me one last wish) There's a  out there  Elementary, I  them all All your mysteries Settle down and in good time We can  all mine  Tell me lies or tell me when Tear me up again And I will let you know when I've had enough Had  of you  Stop  my Confusion Wait, wait  There's a  out there (There's a  out there) Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)  Give me one last wish (There's a  out there) There's a  out there (Don't you deny me)  I know you've got your reasons Hey, let's call it even Turn out all the lights And go to bed  Still I get this feeling No one will  me When I let  ghosts Outside my head  There's a  out there (There's a  out there) Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)  Give me one last wish (Give me one last wish) Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)  There's a  out there (There's a  out there) Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)  Give me one last wish (There's a  out there) There's a  out there (Don't you deny me)
