If I had my way If I had to lose Wouldn't take back one thing,  had much to choose Then it  on me Coming down on you Like a cold sky  under a  moon  You've  all your life Your wish is  true Bless your  for  me  outta you  Miss the misery Need a  for a change Need a  to explain So turn it on again Don't  your mind Your  light Get in and let's go Go  What a nice long leash What a nice  noose Never  for me but sure look good on you You've  all your life Your wish is  true Bless your  for  me  outta you  Miss the misery Need a  for a change Need a  to refrain So turn it on again Don't  your mind Your  light Get in and let's go Go  Miss the misery Gimme a  for a change Miss the misery Gimme a  to refrain Miss your  in a day Miss your  in a day Come on and turn it on for me  Don't  your mind Your  light Don't make this right Don't make this right Get in and let's go Go
