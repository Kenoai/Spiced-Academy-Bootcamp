This  I'm in A  I've  been I'm  to meet you here  Come  this skin I'll let you sink  in And show you everything See you in hell See you in hell  We'll  around the fire And I will lead the choir Sing farewell See you in hell  Come break, my spell Well down the  well We'll find some time to kill  I'll be,  there The buzz  your head The  electric chair See you in hell  We'll  round the fire And I don't need the choir Sing farewell See you in hell
