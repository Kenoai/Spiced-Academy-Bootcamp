I have  a lifetime Waiting for the chance To save you my confession Save the one last dance The same old superstition Haunt us now and then I'm  for ignition To  it all again  We'll burn away Burn away, burn away my pride We'll burn away Burn away, burn away my pride We'll burn away from all the  flames that burn tonight We'll burn away Burn away, burn away my pride  Breathe for me from now on Breathe for me when I'm gone Burn out beyond Out  the sun  Will you  remember There  the skies Walking on the embers Standing in  light The  part is knowing Everything must die The  part is  here Waiting to collide  We'll burn away Burn away, burn away my pride We'll burn away Burn away, burn away my pride We'll burn away from all the  flames that burn tonight We'll burn away Burn away, burn away my pride  Breathe for me from now on Breathe for me when I'm gone Burn out beyond Out  the sun  Burn on, burn on Calling to you Burn on, burn on Calling to you Burn on, burn on  I'll  burn again Never burn again Never burn again Never burn again We'll  burn again Never burn again Never burn again Never burn again
