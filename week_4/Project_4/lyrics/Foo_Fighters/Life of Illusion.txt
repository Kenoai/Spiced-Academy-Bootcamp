Sometimes I can't help the  that,  I'm  a life of illusion And oh, why can't we let it be And see  the hole in this wall of confusion I just can't help the feeling I'm  a life of illusion  Pow!  between the eyes Oh, how  loves her  surprises Wow, it all  so  now It's just one of her  disguises And it  with no warning Nature  her  surprises Continual crisis  Hey, don't you know it's a  of your day Caught up in  solutions That have no meaning, just  hunch Based upon  conclusions Endless solutions Backed up  a wall of confusion  I'm  a life of illusion I'm  a life of illusion I'm  a life of illusion I'm  a life of illusion
