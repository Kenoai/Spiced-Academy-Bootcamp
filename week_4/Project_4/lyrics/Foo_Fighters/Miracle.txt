Crazy but I  this time Begging for  relief A  in disguise Dying  these  eyes I've been  sleep Please come to me tonight  Hands on a miracle I've got my  on a miracle Believe it or not,  on a miracle And  ain't no way That you'd it away  Everything that we survived It's  be alright Just  we're alive Got no  I've been blind Searching  where You're  here in my sight  Hands on a miracle I've got my  on a miracle Believe it or not,  on a miracle And  ain't no way Let you take it away  Hands on a miracle I've got my  on a miracle Believe it or not,  on a miracle I've got my  on a miracle And  ain't no way  Let you take it away Take it away
