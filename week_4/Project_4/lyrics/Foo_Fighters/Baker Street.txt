Winding you way down to  street Light in your head and dead on your feet Well  crazy day You'll  the  away  And  about everything  This city's  makes you feel so cold Its got so many  but its got no soul And its  you so long To find out you were wrong When you  it had everything  You used to  that it was so easy You used to say that it was so easy But you're trying, you're  now  Another year and then you'll be happy Just one more year and then you'll be happy But you're  you're  now  Way down the  there's a  in his place Opens the door He's got that look on his face And he asks you were you've been You tell him who you've seen  And you talk  everything  He's got this  about  some land He's  give up the  and the one  stands And then he'll  down  In some  little town  And  about everything  But you know he'll  keep moving You know he's  gonna stop moving 'Cause he's rolling, he's the  stone  When you wake up its a new morning The sun is  its a new morning You're going, your going' home
