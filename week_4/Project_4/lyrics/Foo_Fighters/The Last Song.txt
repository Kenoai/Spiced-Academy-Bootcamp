This is the sound The here and the now You got to talk the talk, the talk, the talk To get it all out  I listen I listen I listen  But you're out of tune You're so out of tune  This is the last song (This is the last song) This is the last song That I will  to you  Something I've found Yea, That want to turn around You got to walk the walk, the walk, the walk To make any ground  You're pushing You're pushing You're pushing  But  ain't no room No  ain't no room  This is the last song (This is the last song) This is the last song (This is the last song) That I will  to you I made my peace And now I'm trough This is the last song That I will  to you  And  is a name I will  name again I will  name again  We  it doesn't matter We  it all away We  it all away  We pretend We pretend We pretend  But it ain't no use This is the last song (This is the last song) This is the last song (This is the last song) That I will  to you I made my peace And now I'm through  This is the last song That I will  to you To you To you To you
