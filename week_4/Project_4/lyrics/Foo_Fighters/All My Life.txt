All my life I've been  for something Something  comes  leads to nothing Nothing  but I'm  close Closer to the  at the end of the rope All  long I  of the day  When it  around and it's  away Leaves me with the  that I feel the most Feel it come to life when I see your ghost  Calm down don't you resist You've such a  wrist And if I give it a twist Something to hold when I lose my grip Will I find  in there To give me just what I need Another  to bleed One by one  up my  (one by one  up my sleeve)  Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste Weight keepin' me down Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste Weight keepin' me down  Will I find a believer Another one who believes Another one to deceive Over and over down on my knees If I get any   And if you open up wide And if you let me inside On and on I've got  to hide (on and on I've got  to hide)  Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste Weight keepin' me down Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste Weight keepin' me down  All my life I've been  for something Something  comes  leads to nothing Nothing  but I'm  close Closer to the  at the end of the rope  All  long I  of the day When it  around and it's  away Leaves me with the  that I feel the most Feel it come to life when I see your ghost  Then I'm done done on to the next one Done done and I'm on to the next one Done done and I'm on to the next one Done done and I'm on to the next one Done done and I'm on to the next one Done done and I'm on to the next one Done done and I'm on to the next one Done I'm done and on to the next   Done done on to the next one Done I'm done and on to the next one Done done on to the next one Done I'm done and on to the next   Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste Weight keepin' me down Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste Weight keepin' me down  Done done on to the next one And I'm done and on to the next
