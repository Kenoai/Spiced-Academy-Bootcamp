I am a one way motorway I'm the one that  away Then  you back home I am a  light shining I'm a wild  blinding bright Burning off alone  It's  like  you  to live again It's  like  you give and give again It's  like  you  to love again It's  like  time and time again  I am a new day rising I'm a  new sky To hang the  upon tonight I am a  divided Do I stay or run away And  it all behind?  It's  like  you  to live again It's  like  you give and give again It's  like  you  to love again It's  like  time and time again
