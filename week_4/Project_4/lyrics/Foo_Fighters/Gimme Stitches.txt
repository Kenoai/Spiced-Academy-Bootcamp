I can be your  of way So we can get out of here I've  been the one Who runs from everyone Cos everyone's just too weird  Sink with  tied to me I'm  you volunteer Another one has come and gone They  along Make them disappear  Dress me up in stitches It's now or never Tired of  black and blue Dress me up in stitches It's now or never Tired of  black and blue Dying to get my  on you Blood on you  Take  stab at me I  in time I'll heal But  went on and on a bit too long I  out on high street There's  to find out here Another day has come and gone They  along Wasting all  years  Dress me up in stitches It's now or never Tired of  black and blue Dress me up in stitches It's now or never Tired of  black and blue Dying to get my  on you Blood on you  How can you go on When you're  someone Killing me like you do  Gimme stitches Now or never  Before I get my  on you
