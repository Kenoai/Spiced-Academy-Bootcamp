The sun went down on  perfect day Busy  shadows on the wall The  are  up the  bed Roses in the  jar Blood on the thorns Drink  the  is gone  Cracks in the  are deep From  to the  of  burning out Heavy from  your resignations Licking  envelopes Blood on your tongue Drink  the  is gone  Where is your  la now? Where is your  la now? Counting down to zero hour There ain't no  now There ain't no superheroes, they're underground Happy ever after Counting down to zero hour  There ain't no  now There ain't no superheroes, they're underground Happy ever after Counting down to zero hour  Where is your  la now? (where's your  la?) Where is your  la now? (where's your  la?) Counting down to zero hour There ain't no  now There ain't no superheroes, they're underground Happy ever after Counting down to zero hour  There ain't no  now There ain't no superheroes, they're underground Happy ever after Counting down to zero hour
