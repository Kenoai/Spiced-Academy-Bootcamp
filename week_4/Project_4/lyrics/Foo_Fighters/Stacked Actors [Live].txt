Oh  mirror You're  in clear I'm  somewhere in between I'm impressed What a  chest I  meant to make a big scene  Will you  to the  design You look so  when you  up in dreams One more for hire Or  liar? I  its time we all  come clean  Stack dead actors Stacked to the rafters Line up the bastards All I want is the truth  Hey hey now, can you fake it? Can you make it look like we want? Hey hey now, can you take it? And we cry when they all die blond?  God bless, what a  mess Yeah but  aren't  what they seem Your  eyes Your  disguise Never  who to believe  See through Yeah, but what do you do? When you're just  aging drag queen?  Stack dead actors Stacked to the rafters Line up the bastards All I want is the truth  Hey hey now, can you fake it? Can you make it look like we want? Hey hey now, can you take it? And we cry when they all die blond?
