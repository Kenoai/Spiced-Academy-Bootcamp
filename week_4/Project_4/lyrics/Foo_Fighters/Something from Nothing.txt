Give me the  light I'm cold as a match,  to strike So here I go  Here lies a city on fire Singing along The  choir Now here I go  It's  with a spark And burn into the dark Now here I go  There is a  I've found Into the wild Under the ground So here I go  A  on a string And I  everything Now here I go  Oh  ignition be my fuse You have no  you have to choose Bid  to yesterday Say  I'm on my way  But in the end we all Come from what's come before So here I go  Oh  ignition be my fuse You have no  you have to choose Bid  to yesterday Say  I'm on my way  I  it all away because I had to be what  was Been so  I  lie Took my word, I took your wine  And held you in my  hands These  bones and  bands Washed them in the  water Looking for a dime and  a quarter  But you can't make me  my name They'll  make me  my name Pay no mind now ain't that's something F*ck it all I came from nothing  I'm  from nothing You are my fuse I'm  from nothing You are my fuse  It goes oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh It goes oh, oh, oh All rise!  No you can't make me  my name You'll  make me  my name Pay no mind no wait that's something F*ck it all I came from nothing  I'm something From nothing I'm something From nothing
