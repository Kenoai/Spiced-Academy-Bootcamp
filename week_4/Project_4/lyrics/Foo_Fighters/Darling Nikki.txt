I knew a girl  Nikki I  you  say she was a sex fiend I met her in a  lobby Masturbating with a magazine  She said how'd you like to  some time  And I  not  when I saw  Nikki grind  She took me to her castle And I just couldn't  my eyes She had so many devices Everything that  could buy She said sign your name on the  line The  went out And  started to grind  Ahh! Nikki! Oh  The  started spinning Or  it was my brain I can't tell you what she did to me But my body will  be the same Her lovin' will kick your behind Oh, she'll show you no mercy But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind  Woke up the next morning Nikki wasn't there I  all over and all I found Was a  number on the stairs It said  you for a  time Call me up  you want to grind  Ah! Nikki! Oh Ah! Come back Nikki!  Come back!
