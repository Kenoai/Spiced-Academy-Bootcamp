Can you hear me Hear me screamin' Breaking in the  skies This  heart Like  beating Echoing a  miles  Mine is  and  is mine There is no divide In your honor I  die tonight  Mine is  and  is mine I will sacrifice In your honor I  die tonight For you to feel alive  Can you feel me Feel me breathing One last  before I  my eyes This suffering For receiving Deliver me into the  side  For you to feel alive For you to feel alive For you to feel alive Ahh
