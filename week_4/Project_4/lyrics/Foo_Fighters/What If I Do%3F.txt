Back and  that  of  keeps me up at night Help me  to find the  that eat you up inside I go side to side like the  tides in your hurricane And I only hide what is on my mind  I can't explain  What if I do love What if I don't? I'd have to lose  just to find you What if I do love What if I don't I'd have to lose  just to find you  It's my turn, this soul won't burn so  me in the fire Trophies  and  learned, your  little lies We can pave new  with the cold gravestones, wind them  the pines Should I stay or  I go alone? I  decide  What if I do love What if I don't? I'd have to lose  just to find you What if I do love What if I don't I'd have to lose  just to find you  Carolina, Caroline Carolina, Caroline  What if I do love What if I don't? I'd have to lose  just to find you What if I do love What if I don't I'd have to lose  just to find you  Carolina, Caroline Carolina, Caroline Carolina, Caroline Carolina, Caroline
