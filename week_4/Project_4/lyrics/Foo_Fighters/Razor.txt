Wake up it's time We need to find a  place to hide Make up your mind I need to know I need to know tonight  Sweet and divine Razor of mine Sweet and divine Razor  shine  Patience my dear We  spend a  waiting here Maybe this time I hope I get the  to say goodbye  Sweet and divine Razor of mine Sweet and divine Razor of mine  Day  day Cutting away Day  day But anyway  Wake up it's time We need to find a  place to hide Make up your mind I need to know I need to know tonight  Sweet and divine Razor  shine
