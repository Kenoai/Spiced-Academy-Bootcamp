Leading  along Never far from  wrong Never mind  things at all It's nothing  Couldn't find a way to you Seems that's all I ever do Turning up in  and blue Rewarded  All the  we all left  Wait  the time has come Figure that's  time  from Leaving all my  numb Is heaven  Lifted up the fay to seen Anything  never be Anything but play to me In order  Take it back for them to keep Fallen into  deep Not that I had made that leap Anointed  Where have all the  gone Now that all of that is done Wish I would've felt I've won For once
