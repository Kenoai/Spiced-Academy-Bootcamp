Woe is me The end is near,  you'd  leave Heart and teeth Just to  bittersweet One last  to get  the skin Beneath the skin  The wish is  inside The  sigh No one lets  in No one lets  in My exit, no exit No one lets  in  Me and you Draw the line Now it's time to move Face to face Damn the luck,  be Heaven, what's come over me?  The  come inside The  sigh No one lets  in No one lets  in My exit, no exit Go on let  in No one lets  in  No one lets  in No one lets  in My exit, no exit Go on let  in No one lets  in
