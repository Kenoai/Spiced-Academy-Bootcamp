Burn all the  out Make a wish but not aloud Relive the here and now See you now and then I'm a revolvin' door I've seen it all before I will  again But I can't  until I've seen you end  I took a look around I  that in  eyes The treasure's all we've found May be more than needed Now that we're old and worn A  ripped and torn One day we'll be reborn One day I will meet you up again Once again Wait Stop me so I can begin  End over end [Repeat x3] I'm circling End over end [Repeat x3] I'm circling  I'm feelin' out of luck Maybe I just feel too much That old  touch Always  my skin The good in everyone The ties we left undone The  that  your blood All the  bring me 'round again Once again Wait Stop me so I can begin  End over end [Repeat x3] I'm circling End over end [Repeat x3] I'm circling End over end [Repeat x3] I'm circling End over end [Repeat x3] Oh yeah Hey Once again Wait Stop me so I can begin  End over end [Repeat x3] I'm circling End over end [Repeat x3] I'm circling End over end [Repeat x3] I'm circling End over end [Repeat x3]
