When she goes  out I run for cover Rolling like  clouds Hanging  her  Ring in the  hour Spells that I'm singing Rain come and  me out Sinking deep alone  Can you go  round? I will  you down and out Let's go  round I will  you down and  We  just lay around Stare at the ceiling Want to  about One for the feeling  Room full of photographs Box full of letters Come on make it last Nothing else  right now  Can you go  round? I will  you down and out Let's go  round I will  you down and out  Can you go  round? I will  you down and out Let's go  round I will  you down and out  Let's go  round I will  you down and out Let's go  round I will  you down and out
