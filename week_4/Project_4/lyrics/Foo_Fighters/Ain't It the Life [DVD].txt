Dear Haley Can you save me from The  cloud I'm on All you've  do is try Pray you're just  by  Hey wait I  you made it How'd your  crown fall off Tell me how'd you get so tired Fade it down to the wire  Try  a lie and  out The same old guise Wasting time  So very ordinary Wait  my bomb goes off See the  run and hide Fake it all in stride  One day we all can say  we're gone And  the  we're from Everything's so open wide Hear  the divide  Try  a lie and  out The same old guise Wasting time  Ain't it the life Ain't it the life Ain't it the life Got no crime Just sail on by Sail on by Ain't it the life  Try  a lie and  out The same old guise Wasting time
