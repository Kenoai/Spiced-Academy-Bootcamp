Have you been headwired? Were you satisfied? Did it free the  in your spine? Sleeping way  all this time  Will your meet your mind Where the  collides? Will you  yourself When the sun arrives?  I'll just stay behind I've met mine  Better than a  being    Tangled in your  now      Help you feed the wires When your head unwinds? And if our  become entwined You can have all mine I'll be fine  There's a  why Keeping me alive There's a cure in me That I wish were mine As long as I can fight, I'll survive  Better than a  being    Tangled in your  now Better than a  being    Tangled in your  now  Stationed on the wire One day I'll let go Tell them all 'Hello' Tell them all 'Hello'  The sun is on Arlandria  Headwires
