(do you give it away?) Do you let go? (do you let go?) Where do you find it?  Don't  me  in your  rain It's  down the  I go Don't  me  in your  rain It's  a shame, oh no  Don't  me  in your  rain It's  down the  I go Don't  me  in your  rain It's  a shame, oh no  Are you a  afraid? A  alone? A  exhausted? Do you give it away? Do you let go? How do you find it?  Are you a  afraid? A  alone? A  exhausted? Do you give it away? Do you let go? How do you find it?  Are you a  afraid? A  alone? A  exhausted? Do you give it away? Do you let go?  Oh
