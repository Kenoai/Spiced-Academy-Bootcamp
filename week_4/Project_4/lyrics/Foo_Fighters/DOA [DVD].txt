Oh you know I did it It's over and I feel fine Nothing you  say is  change my mind Waiting and I wait at the  night Nothing like the  to  decline  I was down, I fell, I fell so fast Dropping like the  in an hourglass Never say  'cause  last Dancing with the  of my  past  Nevermind there's  I can do Bet your life there's  killing you  It's a  we have to die my dear No ones  out of here, alive This time  What a way to go, but have no fear No ones  out of here, alive This time  Finished, I'm  you off my chest Made you come  in a  dress A  is a  you kept in check Hard to  a  that  this fast  Take a good hard look for the very last time The very last one in a very long line Only took a  to say goodbye Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine  Nevermind there's  I can do Bet your life there's  killing you  It's a  we have to die my dear No ones  out of here, alive This time  What a way to go, but have no fear No ones  out of here, alive This time  Ain't no way, DOA Ain't no way, DOA  Take a good hard look for the very last time The very last one in a very long line Only took a  to say goodbye Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine  Nevermind there's  I can do Bet your life there's  killing you  It's a  we have to die my dear No ones  out of here, alive This time  What a way to go, but have no fear No ones  out of here, alive This time  It's a  we have to disappear No ones  out of here, alive  This time This time This time
