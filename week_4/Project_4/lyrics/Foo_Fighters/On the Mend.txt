One more day that I've survived Another  alone Pay no mind I'm  fine I'm  on my own  I'm here And I'm on the mend I'm here And I'm on the mend my friend  Wake me when the hour arrives Wake me with my name See you  down the line We're  once again  I'm here And I'm on the mend I'm here And I'm on the mend my friend  I'm here And I'm on the mend I'm here And I'm on the mend my friend  Was it you? Sat alone Here we go  Close and stay a while To take me  you go Single file we walk the mile Who's  back home  I'm here And I'm on the mend I'm here And I'm on the mend my friend  I'm here And I'm on the mend I'm here And I'm on the mend my friend  Was it you? Sat alone Here we go Here we go Here we go Here we go
