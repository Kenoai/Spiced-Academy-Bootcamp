There is a secret I  a secret Behind a Soho door  There is a reason I  a reason Beneath the  floor  I  the water The  water And  along its shore  Is that what you want?  The channelâ€™s changing The  is racing From  on a wire  The soul is yearning The cold is burning The  starts a fire  Can we recover Love for each other The  of your life  Is that what you want? Is that what you  want  A river A river A  running  ground  A river A river Is that what you want? Is that what you  want?  I! I! I am a river  Is that what you want Is that what you  want  I! I! I am a river  I am a river!  I! I! I am a river
