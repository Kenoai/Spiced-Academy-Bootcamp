The objective of the project was to explore visual data analysis based on a [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) population csv with Pandas to create an animated graph similar to the one presented in [this video]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo)

While the premise is simple, it was interesting to try and make the final output as representative as possible by representing population size and geogrpahical situation clear, as well as playing around with legend parameters. Ultimately, a balance has to be found between the quantity of information represented and the readability of the graph.

A future improvement on this project would be to use Plotly to improve interactability.
