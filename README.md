# Spiced-Academy-Bootcamp

This repo contains all the projects realised as part of the 3 months Data Science bootcamp I graduated from in September 2022.

[Week 1](https://github.com/Kenoai/Spiced-Academy-Bootcamp/tree/master/week_1/Project_1) - This week was dedicated to discovering Pandas. The goal of the week was to create an animation representing the development of different countries and continents over time using Pandas and imageio.

[Week 2 - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Kaggle competition](https://github.com/Kenoai/Spiced-Academy-Bootcamp/tree/master/week_2/Project_2). The project consists in an EDA on the dataset and the application of various classification algorithms (logistic regression, random forest...) to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on socio-economic and other factors.

[Week 3 - Regression](https://github.com/Kenoai/Spiced-Academy-Bootcamp/tree/master/week_3/Project_3): With this project, I built a regression model on the Capital Bike Share Kaggle dataset, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather. 

[Week 4 - Text classification and command line](https://github.com/Kenoai/Spiced-Academy-Bootcamp/tree/master/week_4/Project_4): We used a naive bayes algorithm to attribute lyrics to an artist based on a scraped lyrics dataset. The whole project was then wrapped as a command-line interface program.

Week 5 was focused on SQL in postgres, therefore no repo for that one ;)

[Week 6 - Docker & MongoDB](https://github.com/Kenoai/Spiced-Academy-Bootcamp/tree/master/week_6/Project_6): I built a sentiment analysis bot able to post and analyse twitter posts relating to generative art on Slack.

[Week 7 - Time series](https://github.com/Kenoai/Spiced-Academy-Bootcamp/tree/master/week_7/Project_7): using different AR models, I analysed the evolution of climate data over the last decades

[Week 8 - Collaboration in Github on Markov Simulations](https://github.com/Nathan-Austin/Project-Markov-Simulation): This project was done in tandem with another student. The goal was to write a program that would predict the behavior of customers in a shop

[Week 9 - Image recognition](https://github.com/Kenoai/Spiced-Academy-Bootcamp/tree/master/week_9/Project_9): I built a CNN from scratch and transfer trained the MobileNet model to recognize different guitar pedals
